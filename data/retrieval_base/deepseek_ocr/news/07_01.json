Shuts Down Officers' Discipline Cases\n\n## Obscure Authority Is Quietly Used to Block Several Dozen Trials in Just a Year\n\n**BY RICH CUNNING**\n\nBrisbane Villalave was in Lower Manhattan protesting police violence in the aftermath of 2020, when officers charged into the crowd. One of them gripped her arm and yanked her to the ground.\n\n“I felt someone on top of me and it was hard to breathe,” she said. “I felt like I was being crucified.”\n\nThe New York City civilian oversight division’s agent that criminalized its police abuse investigated and charged that it could continue a crime.\n\nMs. Villalave received a letter from the oversight agency about its conclusion. “I was happy and was relieved,” she recalled. The next stop was a disciplinary trial overseen by the New York Police Department, during which prosecutors from the oversight agency would present evidence and question the officer in a public forum.\n\nThen last fall, the police commissioner announced.\n\nExercising a little-known authority called “restraint,” the commissioner, Edward Cullen, announced the case would now go to trial.\n\nInstead, Ms. Cullen reached his office and issued a public statement.\n\nHe decided that it would be premature and the prosecutor’s department’s discipline procedure against the officer, Gerard Downey, a lieutenant, was not in the oversight agency’s sight. The officer had the officer under arrest and was in custody. The violation was “reasonable” and necessary, the commissioner ordered on disciplinary grounds.\n\nToday, Officer Downey is a deputy chief of the unit that handles the civil claims against officers.\n\nThis case is one of dozens in which the discipline of officers in the discipline system is being used to discipline officers who were found by the oversight agency to have committed misconduct.\n\nSince close to commission chairman Luty Jahn, he has short-circuited cases involving officers accused of wandering quasi-chaplines, developing lines and beating prisoners with batons. A number of episodes were seen as evidence that police oversight agency, known as the Civilian Complaint Review Board, concluded the officers’ liability control crimes.\n\nIn a typical arrest the United States, New York police commissioner said he has not seen any case of discipline. Commissioners are not in the overburdened civilian oversight boards. But Mr. Cullen’s action aimed to end red tape, before the public disciplinary system.\n\n“What the Police Department is doing here is shutting down cases under the cloak of darkness,” said Florence L. Finkel, a former head of the C.R.E.A. and current vice president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law. “Those actions, and disciplinary trials “means there’s no opportunity for transparency, no opportunity for the public to weigh in, because nobody knows what’s happening out there.”\n\nIndeed, the department does not publish the commissioner’s decisions to retain cases, and the civilian oversight agency makes decisions about public safety mostly after the fact. Ordinarily, an officer at the Fort Lee, Churubusco unit is not told that the Police Department called him to the scene.\n\nTo piece together Commissioner Cabrera’s actions, probably the most detailed arrest records of officers using public records, law-enforcement officials and the public sector sources.\n\nRestraint has been the commander’s chief attribute of the department. In an unprecedented case of 54 officers from going to trial in 2021, the agency now says that it now frames any other commissioner, including its own, in an analysis of C.R.E.B. data. His predecessor, Commissioner Cabrera, was a former police officer.\n\n# French Far Right Gets Big Win, Polling Shows, in Blow to Macron\n\n**BY BOGIE CHEN**\n\nPARIS — The National Rally party on Sunday won a crushing victory on Sunday to mark a crushing victory for the French National Assembly, after reaching a costly projection, bringing its long-due political ambitions and nationalized police to the threshold of new power for the first time.\n\nPolling projections, which are normally reliable and are based on preliminary results, suggested that the party would take about 34 percent of the vote, far ahead of President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Renaissance party and its allies, which took about 22 percent and its third place.\n\nA coalition of left-wing parties ended up the New Popular Front and taking the most moderate seats to the left: France Unie won, showed up 28 percent of the vote to be headed by strong\n\n# Snap Yves Fietz Round Hints at Drastic Shift\n\nport among young people, according to the projection.\n\nTurnout was high at about 57 percent, compared with 475 percent in the first round of the last parliamentary election, in 2022, reflecting the importance ac\n\ncording to voters to the snap election. To many it seemed that the less than the former French president would be a real threat to the ruling conservative administration, which is expected to be a strong factor in the election.\n\nThe result of voting Sunday contrasted with a round on July 7, when the polling party points to each constituency.\n\nThe result of voting Sunday Continued on Page A9\n\n# Female Fantasy, Encoded in A.I.\n\nIn a Retro Loop\n\nWhat does artificial intelligence sound like?
