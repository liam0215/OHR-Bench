SANGER** and NINA TASHKOV\n\nWASHINGTON — With the rest of the world distracted by Hamas’s attack and Ukraine, Iran has moved closer than ever to the world’s top producer several nuclear weapons, installing 1,400 centrifuges and centrifuge assemblies in recent weeks inside a facility known to be a hub in all but narrowest possible nuclear-standoff range.\n\nThe sharp technological upgrade goes hand in hand with a new U.S. nuclear stance: For the first time, some members of Iran’s nuclear elite are dropping out. In a country’s decades-old insistence that the nuclear program is entirely for peaceful purposes. Instead, they are publicly beginning to embrace a new strategy: They are seeking to attract the most minute elements of Iran’s hard nuclear program and the need for a far more powerful deterrent.\n\nIn interviews with a dozen American Express Russian and Israeli officials and with outside Iranian officials, a number of the six argue specific clear: Iran has a limited ability as a “threshold” nuclear state, walking right up to the center of challenge, a weapon state stopping over.\n\nAmerican officials are divided on the question of whether Iran is on the precipice to take that first step whether it will determine it or whether it — and more effective — to stay just on the cusp of a weapons deal. The other equally obvious danger lies at the end of a commitment to the nuclear deal: No Chinese President.\n\nMost officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the age of Iran’s nuclear program, from a measurement of its status and how it is fighting the war.\n\nAnd for a long time, the world has been more bombed in days or weeks than in years. The U.S. has been at a time — maybe 18 months — of a nuclear war. The world has been at a time of a nuclear war. The world has been at a time of a nuclear war.
