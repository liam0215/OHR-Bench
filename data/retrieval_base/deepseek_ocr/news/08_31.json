One of those plans would increase American wealth at least $100 million a year to raise more than 1 percent of the average tax rate of the richest 1 percent of Americans.\n\nUnder the plan, those Americans would see a 3 percent tax cut on a combination of their regular income, like wages, and so-called capital gains, plus the scaled credit carry heath tax bills for the wealthy.\n\nMs. Harris said she is worried about the impact of the tax on wealthier Americans, including those who are in the top 1 percent of the wealthiest Americans, who are projected to be more than 1 percent of the wealthiest in the country.\n\nThose who were concerned about the impact of the tax on the wealthy are worried about the impact of the tax on the wealthy.\n\nThe proposal has hit a nerve with some of the donors who have been forced to support Ms. Harris with the support of donors who have been forced to support Ms. Harris with the support of donors who have been forced.\n\nSome have directed their complaints to the campaign’s advisers and global fundraisers, who say they may be overpresident to be a major donor. As it has not been clear since the 10th, Harris has raised the issue with her in a private conversation, encouraging her to contact the industry and the industry to be more directly involved.\n\nAllies and staff of Ms. Harris have declined to comment on the campaign’s complaints.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to a political action committee and could be asked to provide support to a political action committee and could be asked to provide support to a political committee.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to a political action committee and could be called to provide support to a political action committee and could be called to provide support to a political action.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to a political action committee and could be contacted to provide support to a political action committee and could be contacted to provide support to a political action.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to the political action committee and could be contacted to provide support to the political action committee and could be contacted to provide support to the political action.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to the political action committee and called to provide support to the political action committee and called to provide support to the political action committee and could be contacted to provide support to the political action and could be contacted to provide support to the political action and could be contacted to provide support to.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to the political action committee and called to be contacted to provide support to the political action committee and called to be contacted to provide support to the political.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to the political action committee and called to provided support to the political action committee and called to provided support to the political action committee and called to be contacted to provide support to the political action committee.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to the political action committee and called to been contacted to provide support to the political action committee and called to be contacted to provide support to the.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to the political action committee and called to have been contacted to provide support to the political action committee and called to be contacted to provide support to.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to the.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to the political.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to the.\n\nMs. Harris has also.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to the political action committee and called to.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to the political action committee and called.\n\nMs. Harris has also been asked to provide support to the political action committee and called.\n\n# POLIO EMERGING AS LATEST THREAT IN GAZA CONFLICT\n\n## ON BRINK OF OUTBREAK\n\nFighting to Phase Briefly in a Race to Vaccinate 640,000 Children\n\n**BY LARA JANES**  \nAND THOMAS FILLER\n\nWar and disease have become fiercely intertwined as long as humanitarian efforts on the ground continue to dominate the news.
