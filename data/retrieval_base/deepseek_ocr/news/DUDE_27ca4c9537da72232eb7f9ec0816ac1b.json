    "text": "\"Rebel Deserter\" Gets It Because Yankees Winc'd\n\nBy KENT BEFFLE\n\nA bather waving overboard said, \"To Arms! To Arms! Defend Your Homes and Fire-arms!\"\n\nWith the temperature near 30, it was a poor day for defended- ing fireballs. Maybe that's why George Garrett devoted the Confederate Army at his Flag-Opera Texas.\n\n\"I've been running since Bull Run or some place,\" admitted Garrett, a 19-year-old history major at Arlington State College, as they tied him to a post, and put a blindfold on him.\n\nTerry Branger of the Light Infantry Cavalry, C.S.A., was re- hearing a big joke at Six Flags Sunday. The Rangers in- tercept caught a Yankee spy and executed him.\n\nSome yelling Yankees winced. At evening out of their own get it, however. So, the outfit is get- ting a new outfit. It calls for the liquidation of a Rebel deserter.\n\nGarrett won the big rule. Col. Mack Lambkin, 23, called his troopers together. They were dressed in something akin to Confederate uniforms — but they've switched their former gray wool for tropical wetted.\n\nOne of the Confederates is a Negro, Mickey Carson, 18, a pro-law student at ASC. Every- body does a double-take when he marches by.\n\n\"I'm a true-klowned Negro but I say if you can't beat 'em, join 'em,\" he grinned.\n\nMickey and the others are members of ASC's ROTC marching unit, the Jody Drill Team. History majors in the outfit insist that there were actually some Negro soldiers in the Confederate Army.\n\nColonel Lambkin has plans fast in the Six Flags ranks. \"I start- ed out these young guys just a fifteen,\" he said as grand- ly as any self-made man. Now, at times, he assumes a beard and the role of a Confederate general.\n\nAs a general, he makes a re- cruiting talk to the crowd. He tells them, \"Protect your wives, women, girls, children, horses, cattle, hogs, dogs, sheep, pigs, cats, horses, fire- sides and artillery.\"\n\nEven if it sounds like an in- surance commercial, it works. Little kids flock up to enlist. The general signs the boys into the Confederate Army and the girls into the Women Corps. Gar- rett has shown them how to do right face and left face.\n\nGarrett was still a little vague about which battle he desired as the firing squad assembled. The script hasn't been com- pleted. As a soldier ripped open his tank, the firing squad shouted \"bloody hell.\"\n\n\"Ready! — Aim! —\" shouted the colonel. The crowd was pressing up. Everybody was still.\n\nYou could hear a firing gun drop.\n\nBluesy!\n\nSmoke blew, riflemen flinched, little kids put their fingers in their ears and Terry's Rangers marched off with a hole in their ranks."
