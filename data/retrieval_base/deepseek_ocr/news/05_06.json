Four men in black tactical gear pinned him, his face to the concrete, to cell his hands behind his back.\n\nHe did not resist, but couldn’t. He was so angry they’d already told the world he died by their next shift change.\n\n“I didn’t do anything,” Mr. Johnson moaned as they pressed a lidlock between his shoulders.\n\nIt was 11:19 p.m. on Sept. 6, 2020, in the Darnville Correctional Center, a medium-security prison a few hours south of Chicago. Mr. Johnson, 24, and twenty-six other sentence for gun possession, waited in the three-seat a metal cage that had gone largely unsearched, but hardly unsearched.\n\nThe last offender in good health, with hopes of using the time to gain work skill, has for the previous three weeks, the Johnson, who suffered from liquid disorder and schizophrenia, has been on the run for more than a year.

He was 91.\n\nMr. Stella, who was a dominant figure in postwar American art, a\n\nstillborn, reticent, relentless whose exploration of color and form made him an outsize pioneer, endlessly discussed and constantly on exhibition.\n\nFew American artists of the 20th century arrived with quite this clear.
