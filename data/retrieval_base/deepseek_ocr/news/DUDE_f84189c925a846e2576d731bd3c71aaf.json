The dismissed workers refused to accept alternative jobs. A political society pays the salaries of the dismissed Alba workers, who follow its orders, the sources said. The society is also ready to pay any worker who has been dismissed for taking part in protests, they said. Under the labour law, after a year of dismissal, a worker should choose between a settlement package and a court verdict.\n\n**E-service push**\n\n**THE Housing Ministry, in co-operation with the Central Informatics Organisation, is set to update housing applicants’ data electronically. The ministry has completed updating its website, to include applications for housing services through e-forums, with copies of required documents attached to the e-form, the ministry’s comprehensive periodic report said. Cancelled housing applications will be revised following directives from His Royal Highness Prime Minister Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, on the basis that the application has been cancelled due to transfer only. Three steps have been determined for housing allowance for revived applications: the allowance is to be disbursed five years after the date of the last application. The allowance which was granted before should continue. In the event of allocating loans and reviving the previous application, allowance is to be paid five years after the application revival date.**\n\n**Shaiikh Fawaz with officials at the signing ceremony**\n\n**Kuwaiti preacher Shaikh Nabeel Al Awadhi delivered a lecture at the Reform and Rehabilitation Centre. It was organised by the Interior Ministry in co-ordination with the Justice, Islamic Affairs and Endowments Ministry as part of a series of lectures for prison inmates during Ramadan. Shaikh Nabil stressed the effect of the Quran on people, urging the inmates to read Quranic verses and grasp their deep meanings to realise the right path.**\n\n**Opposition ‘is misleading US public opinion’**\n\nA LEADING US Congressman yesterday slammed Bahrain’s opposition societies for misleading US public opinion, saying that more information must be collected on alleged violations and protests before policies are proposed.\n\nAddressing the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission in Washington, Senator Dan Burton, a senior member of the Congress Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe and Eurasia, said US leaders and the media must look closely instead of being misled by those who want to manipulate the truth.\n\nHe said the term unjustified attacks, which is often used by the media, serves the interests of only one party, which is the opposition in this situation, and it ignores the actions and reactions that occur on a smaller scale.\n\nSenator Burton said he visited a policeman whose house was hit by Molotov cocktails, when his children were inside the house.\n\n“The violence perpetrated by extremists and demonstrators prompt reaction from the government,” he said, pointing out that the US used teargas when demonstrators committed acts of violence.\n\nThe Congressman spoke about his visit to Bahrain University.\n\n“I watched videos showing some of the students who were victims of violence by colleagues who had sided with the opposition.”\n\nSenator Burton pointed out Bahrain’s initiative commissioning former Miami Police chief John Timoney to ensure policemen adhere to human rights.\n\nHe outlined the initiatives of His Royal Highness the Crown Prince to engage in a fruitful multiparty national dialogue, a step which was rejected by the opposition. “Violent protests are not a viable way to achieve desired change,” he said, reaffirming Bahrain’s status as a long-time strategic ally and partner of the US.\n\nThe session was attended by Congressmen Jim Moran, James B McGovern, Keith Ellison and Lynn Woolsey.\n\n![](images/0.jpg)\n\n\nA ghabga was hosted by 2Connect last night at the Ritz-Carlton Bahrain Hotel and Spa.
