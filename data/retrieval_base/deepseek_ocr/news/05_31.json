Brownick, M格罗·Holborn, Kate Cienfuegos, Jesse McKinley and William R. Rashbaum\n\nDonald J. Trump was concerned on Thursday of delaying records for cover up a sex scandal that threatened to derail his 2016 presidential campaign, capping an exit awkwardly that laid itself to the resilience of the American justice system and transformed the former commander in chief into a felon.\n\nThe guilty verdict in Manhattan — across the board, on all 34 counts — will reverberate throughout the nation and the world as it ushers in a new era of presidential politics. Mr. Trump will carry the stain of the verdict during his third run in the White House as voters now choose a new man to supplant incumbent and a convicted criminal.\n\nWhat a new case unthinkable this January would need a claim as the black hole. Mr. Trump's legal team has been working to get a better picture as he boldfaced the country's names, but the record he found to accept his 2020 election loss is already seeking to delegate blame its conviction, attempting to assert the primacy of his raw political power over the nation's role of law.\n\nAs Mr. Trump learned his fate on Thursday, he showed little emotion, shutting his eyes and having ducked away from the head. He described over the cordon. But he chose the emerged leader, telling his wife, \"I'm not going to take the seat of the vice president. He is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one.\"\n\n# Ruan of Luck in Criminal Court Was Ended by a 'Zombie Case'\n\nBy MAGGIE HARRISMAN and JONATHAN SWAN\n\nDonald J. Trump's run of luck in his criminal cases has expired. Before the conviction on Thursday in Manhattan, the former president had been sentenced to a five-year prison term. He decided that the verdict was a \"disgrace\" and, with a somber expression, proclaimed: \"The real verdict is government. No one's. By the people,\" referring to Eastern Iowa.\n\nThe judge overseeing the case, that Mr. Merchan, released Mr. Trump in his own resignation, said the sentence may be July 31, just days before the Republican Party's Conviction Convene was and anothen him as the president of his family.\n\nAviin L. Bragg, the prosecutor who brought the case, declined to reveal Thursday whether he judged could put Mr. Trump behind the noose or give his party, but the former president could receive probation instead, and may never see the inmate of a prison cell. He has vowed to appeal, and will request a new hearing for the presidency while he awaits his sentencing.\n\nThe 12 New Yorkers who convicted him by word record only 19 hours to decide a case stemming\n\nContinued on Page A15\n\nAbin L.

Trump's run of luck in his crimina cases has expired. Before the conviction on Thursday in Manhattan, the former president had been sentenced to five years in prison. He decided that the verdict was a \"disgrace\" and, with a somber expression. Mr. Trump said he had been \"very surprised\" to learn of the conviction, but the former criminal cases that frustrated his five years were stumbling along to quickly that his advisers along to see if the Florida case in which he was charged with obstruction of justice and unlawfully holding onto classified documents, a Trump-renominated judge had spent so much time painting over many cases that the trial would almost certainly be preluded beyond the presidential election in November.\n\nIn the Georgia case, the prosecutor who had charged Mr. Trump for a crime of a conspiracy to overturn the 2022 election was caught in a roomful after well more than the man had tried to help her prosecute Mr. Trump.\n\nAnd with the federal charges over his effort to disrupt the\n\nContinued on Page A9\n\n# Shifting the Blame to His Wife Is a Risky Tact for Menendez\n\nBy BENJAMIN WESER\n\nProsecutors had called their first witness, and Senator Robert Menendez's lawyer-wife eventually said he had been \"very reluctantly approved\" himself.\n\nAs R.J.
