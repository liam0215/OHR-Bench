    "text": "Editorial\n\nMind Your Rudder\n\nBy H. B. Gardner, AKC\n\nMany times in the past I have requested voluntary contributions from our readers for publication in the Skywriter. Many times in the past I have been disappointed by the lack of enthusiasm with which this request was met. Now, at long last, I have a contribution ... not from a fellow serviceman, but, from ... well, read on you'll see!\n\nI could launch into a lengthy dissertation on the People to People program and tell you what an important role it plays in Japanese/American relations. I could also tell you all about how it fits into our Leadership Program. But, I'm going to save my breath. It would seem that I have already wasted my efforts in past issues of the Skywriter. I have been directing words to the wrong people!\n\nRead now this letter submitted to me by a Japanese employee for publication. The writer wishes to remain anonymous to avoid possible embarrassment, although I can see no reason why he would be embarrassed.\n\nNEW BEAUTY DISCOVERY\n\nThe O-Bon Dancing held on August 10 impressed me a great deal. It was the greatest people to people program I had ever seen. Although I have worked at other naval bases for a few years. I have never seen such a heart-warming mingling of American and Japanese people. It surely was a grand night for all of them. I believe.\n\nI noticed many American men wearing Yukata or Japanese summer kimono. But, I say very few American women wearing Yukata. A young Okusan (wife) in Yukata accompanying her husband and children who were also in Yukata, attracted my eyes. She wore a showy, but decent Yukata, Obi (Japanese traditional broad belt), and Japanese felt soled sandals—from every point of view she was exactly dressed as a Japanese women. Not only well fitted to Kimono style, but beautiful she was! With her up-swept hair style, upside down cone shaped posture, she looked just as though she came out of a Japanese costume book. She seemed to captivate even Japanese women's eyes. I noticed young Japanese boys and girls were sending her unsolicited applauses.\n\nA spindle shaped body formation is considered to be most fitted to Kimono. I suppose western women have been believed unsuitable to wearing Kimono because their shoulders are broader than the small, sloping shoulders of Japanese women. However, American women tend to have slimmer lower extremities than do Japanese women, tapering sharply from well formed hips to feet while Japanese women tend to have O-shaped legs. In addition, American women's heads are smaller than those of Japanese. In other words, their heads are equal to 1/8 the total length of their bodies and that is considered an ideal body formation from the aesthetic standpoint.\n\nThese characteristics of body structure well offset the shortcomings of broader shoulders in wearing Kimono. In this regard, the young Okusan with the up-swept hair-do was smarter in appearance than Yvette Giraud, a French chansoniere who once showed up on a TA' show in Kimono with a bulky hanging hair-do.\n\nThe Japanese summer is hot and humid. Mu-mu or traditional Western style one piece clothes may be cooler and more convenient than Yukata. But, Yukata style is much more beautiful than the comfort—first mu-mu or one piece clothes.\n\nI think there were many others who dug out, that night, the long buried treasure of beauty in the American woman's Yukata style. Some must have dreamed of seeing ladies wearing Yukata at their clubs. Why don't you American ladies wear Yukata more—not only on special occasions but, daily, in the evenings at clubs, at restaurants, in the parks or on the street!!\n\nSigned,\n\nA Japanese Employee.\n\nQuestions You May Be Asked\n\nWhen You're Overseas\n\nReprinted with permission from American Abroad, copyright 1961 by American Council for Nationalities Service.\n\nQUESTION—How can your allies be expected to resist aggression if their defense by the United States would mean widespread destruction in a nuclear war?\n\nU. S. defense of its allies would not necessarily involve them in a total nuclear war. In the first place, the principal goal of our political and defense policies is to maintain enough deterrent strength to prevent such a war, and to enable us to negotiate effectively for world disarmament.\n\nIf the deterrent failed—and we are determined it will not—the United States and the Soviet Union, as the nations with the greatest nuclear attack power, would be the primary victims in an all-out war.\n\nWe believe local aggression against an ally can be resisted by our combined military forces whose conventional weapons. A strong and highly mobile force of this type should be a deterrent to attack, and an adequate defense should an attack come."

    "text": "PILOT HAS THE HONOR—Capt. Frank B. Rogers of Marine Fighter Squadron 114 cuts a cake as part of a celebration marking the 20,000 arrested landing by the MABS-11 most unit. The event, which took place at Atsugi, Aug. 15, is believed to be an all-time record for the number of arrestments made by the same piece of equipment. Witnessing the cake-cutting is L/Cpl Frank Musterel, crew leader during the arrestment. (Photo by Cpl. C.S. Maxwell)\n\nMAG-11 Morest Unit Makes 20,000th Catch\n\nThe Morest Unit of Marine Air Base Squadron 11, chalked up its 20,000th aircraft arrestment on Aug. 15, when it caught an F4D \"Skyray\" at NAS Atsugi, Japan.\n\nBy using the same equipment that was installed in September, 1958, after being airlifted from El Toro, Calif. by Marine Air Transport Service's C-124's, the Morest Unit at Marine Air Group 11 has claimed an all-time record for the number of arrestments made by the same piece of equipment.\n\nPilot of the 20,000th landing was Capt. Frank B. Rogers, of Marine (All Weather) Fighter Squadron 114. The plane was caught at a speed of 110 miles per hour.\n\nThe quarter of a million dollar piece of equipment operates on a hydraulic type principle. Designed to catch a maximum 60,000 pound aircraft landing at a speed of 90 knots, the unit is portable, operated by four men, and can receive any type of carrier aircraft. It can also operate around the clock, and is capable of taking in planes at 30 second intervals. In four hours, the equipment can be installed, and re-ay for operation. During the three year period, the Morest Unit caught 14,512 F4D \"Skyrays\" out of the 20,000 arrestments. It also caught 356 planes, which were considered emergencies.\n\nA new ComFairDet Instruction changed the station liberty policy Aug. 13 so that overnight liberty may be granted to personnel of paygrades E-4 and above at the discretion of unit or activity commanding officers.\n\nPersonnel attached to the Naval Air Station will be recommended for overnight liberty by their respective department heads.\n\nCFAD Instruction\n\nThe new policy is covered by CFAD (ADMIN) Instruction 1050.2A. The Instruction indicates that normal liberty hours will commence at 4:30 p.m. on working days and 8 a.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. In general, overnight liberty is to be granted to personnel on leave or with dependents in the area. Normal liberty for E-2 and E-3 will expire at Midnight.\n\nConduct\n\nOvernight liberty will be reserved to petty officers with excellent conduct records and shall no be automatic as a result of pay-grade status. The commanding officer, or his delegated authority, will insure that personnel in this category are carefully screened and meet all requirements with the new instruction.\n\nTours\n\nOvernight liberty shall not be granted to E-3's and below, without dependents in the area, except as a member of an organized tour. An organized tour is defined as a group of five or more men under the charge of an officer or petty officer E-5 or above, who is held personally responsible for their conduct.\n\nA4D Crashes: Pilot Escapes Serious Injury\n\nA Navy Pilot escaped serious injury Saturday, Aug. 11, when he ejected from his crippled A4D jet fighter at 11:30 shortly after taking off from Atsugi on a routine training mission.\n\nLTJG Andrew F. Ciancitto made a successful low-level ejection from his \"Skyhawk\" jet about a quarter of a mile from the end of the runway after experiencing control difficulty.\n\nThe plane landed in an open field after shearing power lines of a nearby electric railway and burst into flames. Atsugi's crash crew quickly put out the fire.\n\nA rescue helicopter, piloted by LTJG William H. Englund, picked up Ciancitto as he stood in an open field near the crash and took him to the Atsugi dispensary. He was later transferred to Camp Zama Army Hospital where he is being treated for a broken shoulder.\n\nCiancitto is assigned to Attack Squadron 23 based aboard the USS Midway. The squadron is temporarily deployed to Atsugi while the carrier is in port in Yokosuka.\n\nAwards, the detachment mustered for basic annual swimming qualifications. Included were a 20-foot underwater swim, a demonstration of the \"tired swimmer's carry\" and a 200-yard endurance swim in which the four basic strokes were used: breast, back, side, and crawl.\n\nAsked the reason for this seemingly unusual formation, Leading Chief John W. Scott said:\n\n\"Two reasons—first, current instructions call for annual swim checks on these people and second, the skipper felt that the crew looked so good at the last two inspections that it would be a good way to reward 'em. I think it's a great idea.\"\n\nHonorary member of the inspection party was D. E. Tomkins, AMHC, who is scheduled for departure to NAS Beeville, Texas in September. Chief Tomkins officiated at presentation of awards to J. G. Yurko, AMSCA; R. C. Cummings, ADRI; J. B. Hill, ADR2; R. P. Bubeck, AMS2; A. H. Price, AE3 and E. R. Griffin AMS3.\n\nThe detachment reassembled for a picnic at 11:30."

    "text": "Utility Economy Urged By Public Works Dept.\n\nBy Lt. Robert B. Wolf\nAssistant Public Works Officer\n\nTo preclude doing without electricity and water for the latter part of September, ALL HANDS will be required to concentrate their efforts on saving utilities.\n\nUnless immediate conservation effectively reduces consumption, the station has only enough first quarter funds to provide power until the 20th of September and domestic water until the 8th of September.\n\nFor the past six months, this station has suffered from a radical curtailment of Maintenance and Operation funds. As a result, the consumption of electric power and water have become a matter of grave concern to station officials.\n\nEffective conservation measures are predicated upon an \"All Hands\" effort. Specific items requiring immediate correction include the elimination of unnecessary lights and air-conditioning, reduction of car-washing and lawn sprinkling, curtailment of use of hot water, etc. Air-conditioning in other than communications and operational locations is restricted to use only when room spaces exceed 85 degrees F. Additional air-conditioning units may not be installed without the specific approval of the Bureau of Naval Weapons (except for Public Quarters, Naval Air Station Instruction 11101.10 of 19 July 1961 applies).\n\nY'hama Jr. High Students Attend Public Works Picnic\n\nStudents from Makigahara Junior High School, Yokohama, were treated to an American style outing August 10 by officers and men of the Public Works Department.\n\nThe day began with a picnic during which 60 youngsters consumed cold drinks, hotdogs and other refreshments. This was followed by swimming, volleyball and badminton. A baseball game between students and public works personnel climaxed the day's events, with the students winning seven to five.\n\nAfter activities, students presented gifts to the military personnel who made their visit possible. Cmdr. John H. Petersen, public works officer, awarded the students a trophy for winning the ballgame. He also gave them a new softball autographed by him.\n\nCELEBRATING the twelfth anniversary of her commissioning, some 100 officers and men of Utility Squadron Five attended a picnic Aug. 10 and Astugi's recreation grounds. Music, featuring country style songs and novelty records, was provided by E.T. Kirkwood AE2.\n\nCPO & M/Sgt. Wives\n\nMembers of the Astugi CPO and M/Sgt. Wives Club have scheduled a shopping tour Tuesday, Aug. 21, to Isezaki Cho in Yokohama.\n\nA bus will leave at 9 a.m. from the Astugi gymnasium and will make a stop at the Yokohama PX around 10 a.m. to pick up club members living in that area before going to Isezaki Cho. There will be a one dollar charge for bus service from Astugi. The bus will return to the air station at 3:15 p.m.\n\nYen will be needed for both shopping and lunch.\n\nClub members are reminded that a rummage sale will be held in the near future and clean, washable and usable items are needed to make the sale a success.\n\nFor further information regarding either the tour or sale, contact Mrs. June Carlson at Astugi ext. 5906."

The building has been taken over by NAS Special Services for use by all personnel.\n\nKnow Your Neighbors\n\nJapaneseCombativeArts: Archery, Kendo, Judo\n\nEditors note:\n\nJapan, long an isolated country riven by Civil War, has a tradition of martial excellence of which her people are justly proud. Some of the arts of War (Bushi-do) have become popular throughout the western world. Thus, the Budo-Ka student studying Karate in Chicago has, in a sense, exported the way of the Samurai to the USA.\n\nArchery\n\nIn the earliest times, Japanese were renowned archers with bows measuring some 7 feet. Bows were so large people were said to have rested and shot them on the ground from a kneeling position. Archery was at a stand still in the Ashikaga period (1336-1573), but experienced a comeback in the Tokugawa period, even though firearms were in use.\n\nToday, archery has become one of Japan's leading sports with annual contests held for men and women.\n\nKendo (Japanese Swordsmanship)\n\nKendo was first used as protection from attack during the Kamakura and Tokugawa periods. It is now practiced as a sport with bamboo swords instead of steel.\n\nOnly the most experienced men today are capable of giving exhibitions with real swords. The steel ones used for exhibitions are able to cut a piece of fine silk in MID-AIR.\n\nJudo or Jujitsu\n\nJujitsu is said to have been introduced to Japan by the Chinese in the 17th century. Dr. Jigoro Kano, a government official during the late 1800's, is credited for having developed judo in Japan from the original art of jujitsu. Dr. Kano founded a judo institution in Tokyo around 1882.\n\nSays Lindy Avakian in his book \"The Secrets of Judo,\"\n\n\"Judo is a derivative of jujitsu and is the correct term used to refer to that art in today's language. The word judo specifically explains the truer meaning of the art as it is practiced today. The ju part of the work means 'gentleness' or 'giving way' and implies a flexibility of techniques, while the do part means 'way' and signifies the application of the ju principle in the execution of the techniques, not only in physical exertions of the judoist but also in his mental attitude. The older jitsu, which was replaced by do, meant 'technique' or 'art.'\"\n\nIn the eighteen hundreds most of the Japanese women knew judo for self-protection.\n\nJudo is as popular today as it was a century ago and has an increasingly number of followers.\n\nExchange Theme \"Back To School\"\n\nSchool for Atsugi dependent commences Sept. 4! What more appropriate time than now to think of all supplies needed to go \"Back to School!\"\n\nYour Navy Exchange has stocks of loose leaf fillers, notebooks, ball point pens and refills, pencils boxes and Sharperers, briefcases, book covers, study aids and many other school time musts.\n\nIn addition to school supplies, a fine selection of attractive and durable clothing and shoes are offered to attire you in the \"bestdressed student\" manner. Follow that leader and shop for all your school needs at your Navy Exchange.\n\nLadies' Consultant\n\nMrs. Gladys \"Pat\" Lesniak, who recently arrived here after working in the Navy Exchange, San Diego Naval Training Command, is now serving as Ladies' Consultant at the station retail store. Pat spent five years with the Exchange in Morocco before going to San Diego.\n\nPayday Hours\n\nAtsugi's Main Retail Store will remain open until 6 p.m. on NAS military paydays.

These surgeons and stewards were not specifically trained to render dental care and their attempts to extract aching teeth and to lance painful abscesses in no way compares with the complete dental service provided in 1962. Today more than 1700 Naval Dental Officers bring modern dental treatment to our servicemen afloat and ashore through the world.

Second baseman Dan Nuckolls opened the inning with a single, moved to second on a fielder's choice and went to third on a wild pitch. The next batter, Ivan Modrick, was put at out first. He was followed by Larry Hammer who popped a high fly to right field. The play to home plate was in time to catch Nuckolls and retire the sides.\n\nAtsugi's big threat came in the first inning when they loaded the bases. Jerry Hicks got to first on a hit pitch, moved to second on a wild pitch and went to third after Morris Braddock flew out to right field. Aaron Smith, batting after Hicks, struck out. The next two batters drew walks to load the bases. Pitcher Sam Moore went down on a called strike three to retire the sides.\n\nThe Flyers got a man to first in the fifth and didn't get a man on base again until the top of the seventh. Lead-off-man Jerry Hicks walked, moved to second on a fielder's choice and went to third on a wild pitch, where he was left stranded.\n\nWinning pitcher Jeff Jefferson went 7 1/3 innings and gave up one hit, walked four and struck out five.

    "text": "Chaplin's Corner\n\nBy Chaplain Homer T. Connolly\n\nEffective Solutions\n\nA professor of mine some years ago commented on the international tensions—how difficult and almost hopeless effective solutions were until people were willing to admit that they were a part of the problem.\n\nIt is only human to place blame for conditions, whatever they are, outside ourselves. This applies to problems within our Christian faith as it does to problems within and outside our nation. As long as we seek to identify other forces only with the problem, and ourselves only with the solution, there is limited chance of improved conditions.\n\nIf there are problems and lack of spiritual vitality within our chapels and nation, to what extent are they due to external influences? Are we likely to solve the problems until we Christians recognize that we, before God, are personally a part of these problems? If there is a lack of spiritual power, if an atmosphere of expectancy does not pervade our worship, can this be attributed to something beyond ourselves? The beginning of the solution may well be our own personal acceptance of and dedication to the fact that \"As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\"\n\nWhat are some personal requirements for genuine spiritual expectancy to pervade our worship?\n\nA drawing near to God. A fresh view of the meaning of our Christian experience and the reality of the Christian faith we share is basic to spiritual prosperity. It is the renewing of our faith that gives us inner assurance and resources adequate to overcome any external difficulty.\n\nAn understanding of the divine task. The work of a Christian and of a chapel is not something of our own making. It is not individually conceived or contrived; it is not an elective course, but a divine assignment to accept. Jesus took the assignment from the Father, completed his part, and that same assignment Jesus has entrusted to Christians everywhere—\"Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.\" Such an understanding of our divine task will call us to a united purpose that overrides all obstacles.\n\nA willingness to perform our Christian task. In the work of Christ, no scheme or plan can ever substitute for the individual Christian's personal service. No one else can engage in worship and fellowship with God for me. No one can serve in my stead. Could it be that the lack of personal involvement on the part of so many Christians is a basic problem for us?\n\nAs we enter into our tour of duty with you as Chaplain and people, we have every assurance that if we draw near to God, recognize the divine and personal nature of the Christian task, and give ourselves devotedly to the performance of the Christian ministry. God will supply whatever is lacking. This is indeed a difficult solution, but God is never far away when we seek his assistance.\n\nDivine Service Schedule\n\nProtestant\n\nRoman Catholic\n\nNAS Chapel\n\nSunday\n0845 Sunday School—all ages 0730 Mass\n0900 Divine Worship 1130 Mass\n1000 Divine Worship and Nursery Weekday\n0800 Junior and Senior Fellowship 0630 Daily Mass\n0900 Divine Worship 1900—2000 Saturday Confessions\n(Vesper Services)\n\nWednesday\n0845 Japanese Bible Study and Worship\n0900 Senior Choir\n\nEast Camp Chapel\n\nSunday\n0830 Worship Service 0730 Mass\n0930 Men's Bible Class 0930 Mass\n1030 Worship Service\n1130 Christian Science Service\n\nWednesday\n0900 Religious Movie\n2000 Christian Discussion Group\n\nChow Call\n\nBreakfast\n\nMonday\nChilled Figs\nScrambled Eggs\nGriddle Cakes\nBeef Paddies\n\nTuesday\nFresh Fruit\nOrange Juice\nEggs to Order\nHam Slices\n\nWednesday\nJelly Omelet\nStrawberry Griddle Cakes\nBroiled Bacon\nGlaed Doughnuts\n\nThursday\nPineapple Juice\nEggs to Order\nBreakfast Steaks\nPecan Rolls\n\nFriday\nChilled Plums\nEggs to Order\nBroiled Bacon\nAsst's Pastry\n\nSaturday\nCheese Omelet\nGriddle Cakes\nSausage Links\nDanish Pastry\n\nSunday\n0730—0930\nTomato Juice\nEggs to Order\nHam Slices\nDoughnuts\n\nDinner\n\nPepper Pot Soup\nConey Island Sandwich\nButtered Noodles\nLima Beans\n\nChicken Pot Pie\nSteamed Rice\nButtered Asparagus\nVegetable Soup\n\nAss't Cold Cuts\nBoston Baked Beans\nChilled Sardines\nPotato Salad\n\nBeef Soup\nLiver Fiesta\nFried Cauliflower\nLima Beans\n\nTomato Rice Soup\nFried Oysters\nMacaroni Republic\nSteamed Spinach\n\nBeef Soup\nPork Chops\nBlackeyed Peas\nPumpkin Pie\n\nOnion Soup\nBeef Steak\nPotato In Jacket\nButtered Corn\n\nSplit Pea Soup\nPork Chops\nBlackeyed Peas\nPumpkin Pie\n\nBeef Soup\nRoast Turkey\nPeas & Carrots\nPie Ala Mode\n\nBean Soup\nRoast Beef\nKidney Beans\nCauliflower\n\nDinner\n\nConsomme Julienne\nRoast Beef Sandwich\nNatural Gravy\nButtered Corn\n\nNoodle Soup\nSwiss Steak\nButtered Peas\nFried Cabbage\n\nCreole Soup\nRoast Veal\nCream Style Corn\nButtered Broccoli\n\nSoup\n\nSplit Pea Soup\nPork Chops\nBlackeyed Peas\nPumpkins Pie\n\nOnion Soup\nBeef Steak\nPotato In Jacket\nButtered Cor\n\nBeef Soup\nRoast Turkey\nPeas & Carrots\nPie Ala Mode"
