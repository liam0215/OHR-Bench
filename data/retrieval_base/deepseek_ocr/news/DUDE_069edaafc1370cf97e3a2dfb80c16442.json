    "text": "Purna Swaraj Day And The Sacred Pledge\n\nTODAY, January 26th, is a Sacred Day for India and Indians. It is the Purna Swaraj or Complete Independence Day. It is the day on which Indians both at home and abroad enthusiastically hail the decision of the Congress whereby it changed its goal from one of self-government for India within the British Empire to one of Purna Swaraj or Complete Independence and total severance from the British. On this day, Indians also take what is known as the Purna Swarajya Pledge whereby they solemnly resolve to carry out the struggle for freedom till Purna Swaraj is attained.\n\nIt was at its Lahore Session in 2589 (1929) that the Congress passed the historic resolution declaring that the word \"Swaraj\" in Article I of the Congress Constitution defining the Goal of the Congress, shall mean Complete Independence, and called upon the entire nation to devote its exclusive attention to the attainment of Complete Independence for India. Soon after, the Working Committee of the Congress met on 2nd January, 2590 (1930) and decided to observe a day all over India as the Purna Swaraj Day and the 26th January, 2590 (1930) was fixed for the purpose. The day was observed with unprecedented enthusiasm all over the country, and was continued to be observed year after year. The 26th day of January became a landmark in our struggle for Complete Independence.\n\nThe Working Committee also issued a Declaration to be read and be adopted by the people all over the country on the Purna Swaraj Day. This Declaration was in the form of a Resolution of Pledge which later came to be known as the Historic Independence Day Pledge. According to the Working Committee's instructions, this Sacred Pledge is to be read in public meetings in town and in villages all over the country, and adopted by the people without distinction of caste, creed, colour, age or sex. Where owing to illness or other physical disability the people are unable to be present at a meeting, they are required to take the Pledge in their homes individually or in groups. The Pledge was thus solemnly taken by every man, woman and child in India on January 26, 1930, and it was renewed year after year on the historic Day.\n\nThe Pledge is a masterly analysis of the right of the Indian people to Purna Swaraj and the urgent need for ending British Imperialism in India. \"The British Government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually,\" says the Pledge and, after explaining the above statements in detail, adds: \"We hold it to be a crime against man and God to submit any\n\nVILE BRITISH PLAN TO COW DOWN INDIA\n\nControl Over Indigenous Industries Revealed In Post-War Schemes\n\nSir Ardeshir Dalal, the so-called Member for post-war planning and development in the Viceroy's Executive Council, has revealed some of the diabolical plans of his British masters to control all Indian industries in the future. Speaking in Madras on Tuesday, Sir A. Dalal warned that all private enterprises would have to submit to government control after the war. He said that the ammunition industries and the production of power and essential commodities, such as fertilisers, would always be owned and controlled by the Government.\n\nEven in the case of other industries, he said, Government control would be imposed on private enterprises. Sir A. Dalal said that he could not give details of the extent to which Indian industries are going to be stifled by the British Government after the war.\n\nCommenting on these plans of the British Government to control Indian industries, competent Indian observers say that if the British Raj is going to exercise such control, it will be very much to the advantage of the British capitalists and very much to the disadvantage of the Indian businessmen. India's national independence is vitally necessary for the right kind of India's industrialization, these observers added.\n\nVILE BRITISH PLAN TO COW DOWN INDIA\n\nVol. 2—No. 23.\n\nVol. 2—No. 23.\n\nVol. 2—No. 23."

    "text": "German Forces Dislodge Soviets In Breslau Area\n\nBerlin, January 24 (Domei)—In Upper Silesia Soviet breakthrough attempts were frustrated yesterday on the eastern fringes of the industrial area. The Fuehrer's headquarters communique said. Attempts by Soviet tank formations which thrust forward between Brieg and Cosel to the Oder River, to cross the river were frustrated. The German High Command said a violent battle is raging for Gilewits and Oppeln in Lower Silesia. In the Breslau area the Germans threw the Soviets out of several localities in determined counter-attacks. Near Kalisch, Posen and Bromberg to the north, grim fighting continues, the German communique said.\n\nIn the western portion of East Prussia the Soviets pushed forward against stubborn German resistance in the northern and north-eastern direction, to the neighbourhood of the south of Elbing and Mohrungen, the German communique said. In eastern East Prussia, Inserburg was evacuated after severe street fighting, the communique said. Soviet attempts to cross the rivers Preger and Delme failed. In the Courland area, after severe artillery preparation, the Soviets launched an attack at a focal point south-east of Libau, as well as south of Frauenburg and north-west of Doben. However, the assault broke down before tenacious German defence. In a grim battle 101 Soviet tanks were knocked out, the German communique said.\n\nOn the Western Front the majority of British attacks between Roermond and Gelsenkirchen were again frustrated. In the course of their strong attacks launched from the north and west the Americans succeeded in entering the completely destroyed town of St. Vith. Heavy local fighting is in progress in the region of Vianden. In north-eastern Luxembourg the enemy attacked up to 14 times throughout yesterday with concentrated fury, the German High Command announced. Between Rappenloch and Hacen in Alsace, German forces pushed forward as far as the sector of Roth and Moder and cleared territory north of that sector of the enemy.\n\nLittle activity was reported from the Italian front. Anglo-American aircraft attacked Western Germany in daylight yesterday, causing major damage to houses especially in Neuss.\n\nWarsaw Government Leaders In Moscow\n\nLisbon, Jan. 24 (Domei)—A Reuter's message from Moscow today reported that far-reaching developments of Soviet-Polish relations are expected following the arrival in Moscow of leaders of the Polish Provisional Government newly established in Warsaw.\n\nMeanwhile, a London dispatch said that 25 Polish organisations in Britain have issued an appeal to the anti-Axis governments, urging them to ignore the Russian-sponsored Polish Government at Warsaw. These organisations maintained that the exiled Polish Regime in London is the only legal representative of the Polish people.\n\nChange Of Trade Investigations Public Here Urged To Co-operate Fully With Vital Waterne Work\n\nThe investigation work in connection with the change of occupation from non-essential to essential once has been going on smoothly and will be completed in the very near future, states the Chairman of the Charge Officers' Committee of the Change of Trade Committee, Syonan, in a statement which he issued to the Press yesterday.\n\nThe work is being carried on by the Sectional Chairman (Heads of Auxiliary Police Division) since the organisation of the Syonan Tokubetsu-ai Tengyo In Kai by the City Authorities in the advice of the City Sanji Kai in August last.\n\nThe work of this fundamental investigation by the Kutyo from house to house is a very difficult one and rather too heavy for him, who has also on his shoulders various other matters to carry out in this decisive stage of the war, but, with the positive co-operation and understanding of the public and the members of his Section, the work has been going on smoothly, it is stated.\n\nWhen the investigation is completed the matter will be deliberated by the Tyuo In Kai and the Authorities, and will finally come up before the In Tyo (the Mayor) for the issue of Tengyo Mere (Order to Change Trade) to those who should change their trade and for the issue of Certificates for those who should remain.\n\nBut to the Tengyo Sya (persons affected by Change of Trade) due facilities will be provided, as far as possible, in regard to the following important factors: There are several kinds of business which must be changed and the Authorities will direct what types of business the person can change into and he can make his choice from them.\n\n(b) After the issue of the Change of Trade Order a period of 50 days to 60 days to 60 days to 60 days to 60 days to 60 days to 50 days to 50 days to 50 days to 50 days to 50 days to 60 days to 60 days to 60 days to 60 days, to settle their stock and make necessary arrangements.\n\n(c) There will be a Trust Department of all Communities and the City Authorities will do their best for the disposing of the commodities.\n\n(d) The person who, due to unavoidable circumstances, cannot comply with the Tengyo Order, can appeal to the Tyuo In Kai.\n\nOnly a number of business is allowed to remain in order to keep the minimum life of the citizens under wartime conditions. Therefore it is urged that they will co-operate to build up a healthy economical world under the direction of the City Authorities.\n\nThe City Authorities earnestly hope that all Syonan people will co-operate with the Government in this hard task with the spirit of fairness and kindness and march on to victory together with the Military Administration.\n\nIf any offence, who by any dishonest means, escapes the Change of Trade, such a person will be treated as public enemy and anyone who continues the intentions of the Military Administration will be punished and may not be given any protection as a citizen, council, etc.\n\nKosei-Ka Cho Explai ns Aims Of Employment Restriction Laws\n\nAn appeal to the class of workers affected by the Male Employment Restriction Ordinance urging them to give their full co-operation in the measures taken by the Authorities to mobilise their services, was made by the Kosei-ka Cho (Mr. Mamoru Shinosaki) in a statement which he issued to the Press yesterday.\n\nIt is revealed that by the operation of this Ordinance, according to present information, more than 20,000 workers, between the ages of 15 and 40, will be affected.\n\nThe Kosei-ka Cho emphasized three important points—(1) manpower, (2) materials, and (3) transportation—which he stated must always be kept in view in connection with the current war. In conducting a large scale war it is necessary, the Kosei-ka Cho stated, mobilisation of manpower for essential services should be carried out very rigidly. In this connection the mobilization of manpower in Malai is not yet complete, declared the Kosei-ka Cho.\n\nThose people who do not come within the provisions of this Ordinance—those below 15 and above 40—can carry on these\n\nworks thus replacing all those who come with the purview of this Ordinance. Those affected by the Ordinance will be drafted, or service is to be drafted, etc.\n\nOn the fighting fronts Polish soldiers would do the fighting without the home fronts all able-bodied civilians must do their work for the production of war materials and food supplies. Syonan is an important source of food for the fighting forces and as such, people must strive to further the Kosei-ka Cho.\n\nTo replace all those affected by the Ordinance the Kosei-ka Cho urged especially women to come forward and fill in and those outside the prescribed ages who are physically unfit to perform essential work can be substituted.\n\nClose investigation will be carried out by the Auxiliary Police very soon and every case will be properly gone into. Those who give false information to the Auxiliary Police will be punished according to the regulations.\n\nIn drafting these people for service the Authorities will give them the option to choose the kind of work most suited to them according to the list supplied by the Labour Office, pointed out to the Kosei-ka Cho.\n\nEnemy Difficulty In Pacific War Zone Mounting\n\nIn Pacific War Zone Mounting\n\nBy A Domei Military Comm. Tokyo, Jan. 25 (Domei)—The difficulties arising from extended supply lines are now before United States forces which recklessly embarked on the invasion of Luzon Island. The United States in its operations in the European theatre of war, found 50,000 tons of bottom unloaded over a row or three weeks period was sufficient to transport one division of troops. But, the Philippine front is not the Philippine front, and the United States to its dismay finds that to transport the same single division of soldiers to the Philippines islands, no only is 200,000 tons of shipping needed, but it would take more than two months to move the immense haul of radio of shipping the United States must employ in the Pacific war theatre is seven to three when compared with the European war theatre. The extended supply line to the Philippines may be truly said to be unprecedented in war history.\n\nSurprising is the fact that the enemy, after enormous sacrifices—sacrifices vast enough to endanger anti-Axis war plans—was only able to place five or six divisions on the Luzon front. To feed these divisions on Luzon Island, its operational strength, the enemy must continuously increase his supplies.\n\nEnemy operations on Luzon Island meanwhile, have failed to achieve any perceptible progress and on the contrary enemy forces are falling victim to the effective tactics of our assault units. Out of growing impatience, the enemy, by further reinforcing his strength, is attempting to speed up the opening of a decisive battle. But our forces are coolly and firmly taking a waiting stand which is adding to the enemy's irritation.\n\n5 Days More For India New Year Fund To Close\n\nThe New Year Gift to India Fund which closes on Jan. 31 is being enthusiastically supported by the various sections of the Indian community in Syonan, it is understood.\n\nThe Local Affairs Committee which collected recently a tidy sum of $200,000 towards Netaji Fund has been made to house collections for the\n\nThe local affairs committee is a decided concern of the local people and the people of the local people.
