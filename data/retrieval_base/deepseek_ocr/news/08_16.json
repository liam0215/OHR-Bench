Shore; Katie Rogers and Adam Ewing.\n\nWASHINGTON — In the end, he was glad.\n\nConflicted to a space between an his vacation home and fighting for his country, fighting from Covid, President Biden was exhausted. He was terrified for the couple on Saturday, July 20. Whether he would be able to finish up or not at all, people close to him said he took the long drive by himself to mull over the historic decision he was about to make.\n\nHe had just been through a horrendous day in Rochester, Minn. Del, and he huddled with his wife, who was in pain, and discussed how he would travel to a screened-up city, a sitting area with of the living room.\n\nSteve Baccetti, the president’s eyes and ears on Capitol Hill, and Mike Daniels, his chief strategist, had shared internal polling with the Biden team that Saturday night, mirrored what American had experienced with voters: Mr. Biden was falling behind, naturally and by his own choosing.\n\nThere was still a path to victory, they said, but he, the right, had to be able to win. The president who had been the president of the country, had all of his party in Congress and Democratic voters who had concluded that he was too old to run.\n\nFor more than three weeks, Mr. Biden had insisted he would step in the race. Only the “Lord Almighty” he said, could get him to\n\n# do.\n\nBut by that Saturday evening, something had shifted.\n\nIt was not just about the polls, people close to Mr. Biden, who desperately overstayed the line, believed he could still claim the Democratic nomination and beat former President Donald J. Trump. And so they sat in the pews with him.\n\nHe had begun to change the president’s mind, people familiar with his thinking say, but no realization that the support in the race, or was in it, had yet to fully mature. But the president’s support was in for a lurchy battle that would rip apart the Democratic Party, the cause he had served nearly his entire life. Would an alien who knew nothing about the ultimate consensus builder in Washington want to argue with a party that had wound its course to the failure of a rich man?\n\nThat day, Mr. Biden asked a key question.\n\n“If we were going to do it,” Mr. Biden said, “then we absolutely would we say?”\n\nA statement was drafted, always not to fear other people, but they had not been the last. Anthony Brennan, the president’s son Hunter, and Austin Tommasini, the gatekeeper at the White House and the president’s deputy chief of staff.\n\nBut, in fact, he wanted a new president.\n\nAs if he, that evening, the president-elect announced it. It was time to call it a day.\n\nTranymy students, it seemed almost.\n\nContinued on Page A11\n\n![](images/0.jpg)\n\n\nPresident Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday in Los Angeles, Mr. Biden left yesterday before he dropped out.
