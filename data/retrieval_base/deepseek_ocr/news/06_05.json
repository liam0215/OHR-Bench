SHEAR**\n\nWASHINGTON — Looking for a way to shut down the southern border in 2018, President Donald J. Trump floated a 7.5-year period during the asylum battle that he said gave him “magical authority” to keep migrants out of the country.\n\nPresident Biden turned to that task decades earlier on Tuesday to block executive action to temporarily close the border to asylum seekers, suspending longstanding immigration law that bars people from entering the U.S. and bars their right to apply for asylum.\n\n“The simple truth is, there is a worldwide migrant crisis,” Mr. Biden said in the White House. “And the United States doesn’t stop one border; there is no limit to the number of people who can come in to come here.”\n\nMr. Biden’s announcement is a response to several a presidential and a party’s final stop parties in the past: the American and the country of immigration. When he announced it, Biden’s own announcement to his office of the executive section of the White House, he said, “I am relieved to see a new administration that is focused on the needs of the American people.”\n\nA dozen years later, with the border already inching dangerously close to the border, Mr. Biden is urging Congress to pass a new law to temporarily close the border.\n\nA dozen
