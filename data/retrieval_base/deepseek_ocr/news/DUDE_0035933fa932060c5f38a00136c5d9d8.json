    "text": "Regionals News\n\nRegion's Leaders Assemble at Big Sky\n\nby Jack de Golla, Public Affairs Officer, Beaverhead National Forest\n\nThe 1990's are upon us. As the Forest Service moves into this final decade of its first century, we face new public attitudes, new demands, new stresses, and a new workforce. How can we adapt to all this newness and make the 90's a \"Decade of Quality\"?\n\nThat was the central question the Region's leadership faced at a week-long session at Big Sky, Montana, April 2 to 6. Gathered in the shadow of the Gallatin NF's Spanish Peaks were most of the district rangers, forest supervisors, staff officers, and Regional Office directors.\n\nFollowing are some highlights of the conference. A complete summary will be available at each Forest.\n\nOn the opening day, the conference heard from Representative Pat Williams, the Montana Democrat from the First Congressional District. Williams charged that partisan politics were crippling Forest Service management and planning. He said Montana and Idaho have been energy \"colonies\" and that political interference in the management of the West's natural resources has reached an unprecedented level.\n\nWilliams said that the public will not long be denied in determining how the national forests are managed. He pointed to the agreement the Deerlodge National Forest reached with its Forest Plan appellants as an example of people finding local solutions, which he said are key to the future.\n\nNext, the group heard from Pat Jackson, a nationally acclaimed public relations expert. Jackson described the American public in the 90's as people overcommitted and overcommunicated with, only 8 to 10% being concerned\n\ncontinued on page 2\n\nForest Supervisors Fred Treeby addresses attendees.

    "text": "The \"Decade of Quality\"\n\nG eting together with the Region's leaders in April was an ideal way to begin the 1990's - the beginning of a decade I term \"The Decade of Quality.\" It is also a \"Decade of Change\" - changes in staff, changes in legislation, and changes in attitudes. These are all changes which will help to bring about quality.\n\nOur challenge in taking care of public lands today is tremendous. Our job is far more complex today than it used to be, and the complexity will continue. It's critical that we don't cling to old ways of doing business. We must be open, creative, and be agents of the changes that are coming, rather than be the effects of change.\n\nThe Forest Service can be the agency at the forefront of conservation in the world. We can and must be the leaders in wilderness management. We must set the mark; others will follow.\n\nMuch depends on you - each of you. As I told the people at the Regional Leadership Conference, consider a cup half filled with water. Is it half-empty or half-full? A half-empty cup may be considered a burden; a half-full cup, a challenge. It is your attitude that will make the difference.\n\nI have confidence in Region One folks. You are a dedicated, loyal group of people, and I can't think of anyone I'd rather work with as we meet the changes and challenges of the 90's.\n\n1990 Leadership Conference, continued from page 1\n\nabout national forest issues. He said people want personal messages when they are interested in something. He said the letters \"P R\" stand for \"personalized communications.\"\n\nJackson said people don't care about the facts; they act on perceptions. (The phrase \"perception is reality\" was repeated throughout the week by many others who spoke.)\n\nHe noted that people form their opinions by checking with their \"opinion leaders,\" and said the Forest Service needs to focus its attention on opinion leaders and then work on their expectations. Jackson urged each person at the conference to find out who the real opinion leaders are around their Forest, and then assign an employee to each one. He suggested that we allow for personal communication between that opinion leader and employee throughout the year. Public affairs, he concluded, is each employee's job.\n\nThe next two days of the conference featured short concurrent sessions in such subjects as forest plan implementation, riparian management, public opinion, and biodiversity.\n\nOther guest speakers included Kimberly Woods, a consultant on human behavior, Dr. Jim Brock, Montana State University, and Dr. Caleb Rosario, Elizabethtown College, PA. A panel of Forest Service leaders presented findings of a survey of employees' attitudes and frustrations.\n\nThe last day the conference heard from Linda Rix, the Region's consultant on affirmative action. Ms. Rix said \"numbers give marvelous illusions, and rarely tell the story.\" She said activity should never be confused with accomplishment.\n\nShe praised the Forest Service for making \"workforce diversity\" a real management responsibility and not just a perfunctory process, as it is in many agencies. Rix's main point was that affirmative action programs are for the long term and should try to improve work life for all employees. The ultimate goal is for no job to be reserved for one group or another.\n\nThroughout the conference there was an exhibit area in the main Huntley Lodge. Exhibits on several national forests and many subjects, ranging from smokejumping to minerals management, were on display.\n\nSo, what was the value of the conference? The speakers, exhibits, and sessions all helped people learn things. But, perhaps the greatest value for the people attending was the chance to see people they ordinarily didn't see, from a spectrum of specialities and places. The after-hours discussions did as much to bond everyone to the common task as anything that was on the agenda.\n\nIf nothing else, everyone became more aware of the challenges of the new decade, heard others wrestling with similar issues, and perhaps found the seeds of ideas that can sprout and flourish during the Decade of Quality."

Their company during this time of year are the other 200 head of pack and riding stock wintered at Ninemile for various districts in the Region.\n\n\"This first year was an overwhelming success\", pack train manager Bob Hoverson stated, \"both in terms of how well the pack train was received by the public, and in the smooth logistics and liaison with local Forest Service units.\" Over the last year the pack train worked in five Northern Region wilderness areas, supplied equipment to two fire suppression efforts, and performed at 35 public events in Regions One, Four and Five. An exhibit demonstrating light-on-the-land handling of stock, and how the public can minimize their wilderness impact, accompanies the pack train and has been a very popular attraction. Although not the objective, the pack train brought home several awards for their performances at the public events.\n\nThis winter a steering committee consisting of Jim Dolan, (RO), Tom Kovalicky, (Nez Perce NF), Tom Griffith, (Deerlodge NF) Keith Parrish, (Helena NF), Smoke Elser, (private sector representative), and Dean Solheim and Bob Hoverson, (Ninemile RD), wrestled with the difficult task of scheduling the pack train for the 1990 season. Last year the emphasis was to accommodate the centennial events of Montana, as well as North and South Dakota. Priorities for 1990 are Idaho events, as it is their centennial year. The number of work projects will also increase. This year the pack train will be able to accommodate eight backcountry work trips, 20 parades, 15 display setups, and will assist in 4 training sessions.\n\n\"We are very fortunate to have top quality people accompanying the pack train,\" emphasized Bob. \"Dean Solheim, Cal Samsel, and volunteers John and Vivian Christensen have a combination of tail\n\nChanging Their Shoes and Catching Their Breath\n\nby Greg Munther, District Ranger, Ninemile Ranger District\n\nThis is the Pack Train schedule for the remainder of 1990.

Landowners Buz and Les Hodges, who generously share their fields with the bighorn sheep herd, donated the land for the vehicle pull-out. A high school shop class built cedar benches for the area; a local nursery donated plants for landscaping; timber companies donated building materials; and two sporting organizations worked with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, volunteering their labor to build a pole fence to keep visitors out of the field and sheep off the pull-out.\n\nAs part of their new wildlife appreciation program, the Lolo NF supplied six interpretive signs that describe bighorn sheep biology, habitat, and management.

Annually, in May and June of 1990, each Forest sponsor a 2-4 person team of birders who try to locate as many species of birds as possible in a 24-hour period. The search area must be inside or within 15 air miles of the competing Forest.\n\nA state-wide coordinator will compile the lists and share information with all Forests and interest groups. A suitable, travelling plague will be awarded annually to the winning Forest. In 1990 the coordinator will be Carl Wolf, Custer National Forest. Contact him by Data General: R01F08A, or call (406) 657-6361 (commercial) or FTS 8-585-6361. Copies of rules, forms and guidelines can be obtained from him."

    "text": "Kootenai National Forest\n\nRecycle - Recycle - Recycle - Recycle - Recycle\n\nby Dellora Gauger and Alice B. Elrod, Fortine Ranger District\n\nW hat do you do with your used pop cans and glass containers when they are empty? What about paper you don't use any more, boxes when they are emptied, junk mail, or computer printouts no longer needed? Do they just get trashed and hauled to a dump or landfill somewhere? or are you participating in a recycling program?\n\nFortine Ranger District employees were recently challenged by David Nesbitt, Elizabeth Manzo, and Alice B. Elrod to change their ways and be more conscious of their impact on the environment. The three researched what it would take to recycle paper and aluminum used on the District. As a result, several employees got together on their own time and built recycling boxes to receive recyclable materials. And an attractive environmental bulletin board has been placed in the office for the latest in environmental news and ideas.\n\nThe program is District-wide. A storage area is located on the compound for recyclable glass, paper and aluminum. Everyone is encouraged to collect and bring in recyclables and help transport them to Flathead Industries, the recycling center in Kalispell.\n\nBecause of these employee's efforts the District has found a solution to 1) wasted paper that comes through the printer, 2) cardboard boxes, 3) empty aluminum cans, and 4) guilty feelings for throwing out recyclable/ reusable products.\n\nAs the saying goes, \"If you're not recycling, you're throwing it all away.\"\n\nThis newsletter was printed on recycled paper !!!!\n\nOFFICIAL BUSINESS\n\nPENALTY FOR PRIVATE USE, $300\nADDRESS CORRECTION REQUESTED"
