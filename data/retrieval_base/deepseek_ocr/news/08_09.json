No. 60,241 2/23 The New York Times Company FRIDAY, AUGUST 9, 2024\n\n# Trimme In House Paved the Way For Walz’s Rise\n\nDemocrat Successful in Conservative District\n\nBY CATE EDMONDSON AND LEE RENOWITZ\n\nWASHINGTON — Representatives Tim Walz and his traveling across northern Minnesota, when it is 2014, holding town halls across northern Minnesota, when a voter contended him with a prickly question about his support for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPresident Barack Obama’s signature legislation was approved to save families thousands of dollars in health care premiums but still proved costly for some, the voter said. “What happened?” he man demanded.\n\nSome Democrats in politically vulnerable swing seats like Mr. Walz who had supported the bid tried to backpedal from the vote, a choice that voters punished them for at the ballot box later that year.\n\nNot Mr. Walz.\n\nInstead, Senate Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who shared the stage with Mr. Walz, refused to go an interview the day he stood by his decision. “He didn’t try to hide from the vote,” she said. “He handed it in.”\n\nMr. Walz acknowledged there was a “very real risk” that the Senate could be defrauded the law in the process. “I don’t pretend that it was some type of safe harbor because of the way the law was written,” he said.\n\nMr. Walz, who served in the House for more than a decade, officially voted later, recounting, for Mr. Arafat, the Affordable Care Act and the failed climate change bill, saying he opposed the gas emissions. It appeared a successful effort to raise the minimum wage and oppose Republican calls to raise the minimum wage.\n\nMr. Walz said he was “very concerned about the cost of the bill” and that he was “very concerned about the cost of the bill” and that he was “very concerned that the bill was passed.”\n\nMr. Walz said he was “very concerned about the cost of the bill” and that the bill was passed.\n\n“I’m a Republican,” he said. “I’m a Republican.”\n\nMr. Walz said he was “very concerned about the cost of the bill” and the bill was passed.\n\n“I’m a Republican,” he said. “I’m very concerned about the cost of the bill” and the bill was passed.\n\n“I’m a Democrat,” he said. “I’m very concerned about the cost of the bill” and the cost of the bill was passed.\n\n“I’m a Democrat,” he said. “I’m a Republican,” he said. “I’m very concerned about the cost of bill” and the bill was passed.\n\n“I’m a Democrat,” he said. “The cost of the bill” and the bill was passed.\n\n“I’m a

passed.\n\n“The cost of the bill” and he did not say.\n\n“The cost of the bill” and he did not say.\n\n“The cost of the cost of the bill” and he did not say.\n\n“The cost of the cost of the cost of
