As a rapper, Walberg was part of the 1991 hit “Good Vibrations,” the album that sold 1.8 million copies.

Maimoni, 48, was found guilty of second-degree murder yesterday of a woman sentenced to life in prison for killing Martha C. Brailleard aboard his sailboat on July 12, 1991.\n\nIt took a jury of nine men and three women nearly 7½ hours to discard Maimoni’s claims of death by accident and to determine that he murdered Brailleard when she rejected his sexual advances.\n\nMaimoni chewed gum, declined to make a statement, expressed no emotion and was led away after handcuffs closed around his wrists. He will be eligible for parole in 18 years.\n\nIn the lobby of Essex Superior Court, Paul Brailleard, Martha’s father-in-law, looked to the ceiling and said, “Thank God it’s over.”\n\nDefense attorney Jeffrey A.

George E. Brown Jr. (D-Calif.), who vowed to fight what he says is a dangerous and growing trend amounting to “eastern” “peril-bearing.”\n\nThe formidable clout of the Massachusetts congressional delegation in past years has won\n\n$158,861,000 for science and technological facilities in the Commonwealth since 1980. Individually, Boston University and Tufts have received $615 million and $61 million respectively in earmarked funds, placing them 10th and 11th out of the 161 universities surveyed by the Congressional Research Service.\n\n“Money that is diverted by Congress to fund earmarks comes out of the hide of other programs - publicly\n\ndebated, peer-reviewed, carefully scrutinized programs,” said Brown, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.\n\n“This is not a legitimate way of funding science,” Brown said.\n\nBrown, who spoke at a briefing yesterday at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Boston, questioned funds obtained by Tufts University and the University of New Hampshire, along with 48 other universities nationwide that obtained a total $225 million through earmarking fiscal 1993 appropriations bills.\n\nEarmarking refers to a tactic in which congressmen add to a piece of legislation to prevent that appropriations money to a specific institution.
