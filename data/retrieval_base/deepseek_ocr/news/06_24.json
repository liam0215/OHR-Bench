Mr. Zuckerberg said he had “not found the “defect” on staff” of the company.\n\nA month later, Instagram’s head, ultimately declined to finance the project, two, writing in an email: “Unfortunately I don’t see us funding this from Instagram any time soon.”\n\nThe email exchanges are just one slice of evidence cited among more than a dozen lawsuits filed since last year by the attorneys general of 45 states and the District of Columbia. The states accuse Meta of unfairly narrowing the treatment and choices in Instagram and Facebook while decreasing the public’s access to the app, including a crackdown on the growth of the group’s earnings, according to a report from the 1990s, the attorney general’s work to ensure Meta is not given protections for minors.\n\nA New York Times analysis of the state’s court filings — including roughly 1,400 pages of comments and dozens and comparisons filed as evidence by the State of Tennessee — shows how Mr. Zuckerberg and other Meta leaders repeatedly promoted the safety of the company’s platform, which grew into a key sponge for the app, even as they rejected employees’ calls to bolster youth safeguards and other additional anti- in diversity, the attorneys general of several states sued Meta and Mr. Zuckerberg had led his company to drive user engagement and the expansion of child- and child- and child- and child- and child- and child- and child- and child-\n\n“A lot of these decisions ultimately landed on Mr. Zuckerberg,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “But for the attorney general of New Mexico, the need to be able to safeguard and to hold to account explicitly, for the decisions that he made.”\n\nThe state’s lawsuits against Meta reflect mounting concerns that teenagers and children are on social media can be sexually solicited, harassed, bullied, body- shamed and algorithmically induced into compulsive online use. Last May, the D.C. Youth & Family, the U.S. surgeon general, ordered the warning labels to be placed on social media, a public health risk to young people.\n\nThe warning could boost momentum in Congress to pass the Kids Online Safety Act, a bill that would require social media companies to\n\nA new York Times analysis of\n\n# Amid Diverse Set of Advisers, an Old-School Inner Circle\n\n### BY KAITI ROGERS AND JESSICA WILSON\n\nWASHINGTON — The panel of advisers to President Biden’s son Jack, President Biden’s son, and his 10 children, a close adviser since the 1980s, is the one that has the most influence.\n\n“What you’re mostn’t what?
