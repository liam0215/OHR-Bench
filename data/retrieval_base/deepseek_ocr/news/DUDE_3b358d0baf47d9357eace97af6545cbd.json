    "text": "The Exile of the Shekhinah\n\nRabbi Alijah Dessler\n\nR ecognition of God in the innermost heart continues the Shekhinah's resting upon Israel. As the Rabbis of blessed memory said, \"And I shall dwell in YOUR midst\" (Exodus 25:8) is stated in the plural, not in the singular. Even when a person is within a great eclipse of the soul—a condition of actual Tumah—nonetheless the innermost holy spark latent within every heart of Israel is not extinguished. This is included in God's promise \"... I will not cast them away, nor will I abhor them to destroy them utterly...\" (Leviticus 26:44). But through iniquity and sin and through cozying up to Tumah the human forges an iron wall separating the holy point residing in the heart and the I, causing the holy spark to fall into Tumah and rendering it useless in illuminating the soul. This then is the meaning of \"the Shekhinah in Exile\"—that the innermost point of the human is not revealed and illuminated, but hidden and darkened.\n\nThere is \"the Exile of the Shekhinah\" of the individual—the innermost point of a singular being—and there is the \"Exile of the Shekhinah\" of the group—when the nation as a whole pushes aside its holy spark through gross materiality and ignorance. This is the worst condition that a person can be found in, when the thread of one's spiritual life and attachment to holiness is almost severed, approaching total loss. This condition spread into the community is a condition of Hurban. If one neither feels nor is pained by this, that itself is a sign that Hurban has overtaken. But one who feels \"the Exile of the Shekhinah\" within and is pained—with a pain that approaches weeping—by the inability to cleave to the Blessed Name and by the Hurban of the Temple of the Heart—this itself is a Tikkun of the Exile of the Shekhinah of the heart. As the Rabbis of blessed memory said—\"whoever mourns Jerusalem will merit to see its happiness.\" (Taanit 30). This means that even presently they can see the Tikkun of their innermost heart and they can rejoice over that. This is the meaning of the eternal weeping established for all generations (over the Temple)—even as it reflects punishment it is the only road to Tikkun. Moreover, all travail that God brings is in order to provide soulful opportunities for one to be pained for the spiritual destruction within the heart. And this is the path of redemption.\n\nExcerpt from MIKHTAV MA-ELIYAHU (Vol II, page 47). Translation by Rabbi Daniel Landes.\n\nSteve Silberman\n\nSaid, \"Take me some place Jewish\" we drove down ancient December avenues around Bowery until a delicatessen, with blue windows dripping silhouetted cavernous, half-empty, knots of mostly older white-haired Jews sipping tea or soup—I took a ragged slice of brisket and sat down my father and mother and me. Soon a frail apparition at my father's jacketed elbow, almost mischievous of aspect, obviously curious and with a secret. \"Are you,\" she addressed my father, \"a college professor?\" pronouncing the words as if in a foreign language, carefully. It is happy to say yes, happier to tell the truth, and wonderful to have guessed rightly and not made a fool of oneself—She asked then, \"Are you a Communist?\" kvelling over her accuracy, already we were set apart from the gossiping mob busy with fork and plate. Not afraid to tell her life story began her recitation, gathering into it the Czar, Lenin, certain offices of the Politburo and duties as a secretary—nothing startling if I remember, execution of policy and the confidences the job entails; along with a midnight getaway—some wealth—not necessarily hers—through ballroom-red teardrop earrings glittered and danced where once something more beautiful—the last question: \"Do you know the Internationale?\" She sang, and wept. Of her weeping and singing there is nothing in the ancient texts; but of the phrase \"The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended\" Rabbi Yitzhak said, \"All prayers and hymns are a plea to have His glory revealed throughout the world. But once the whole earth is, indeed, filled with it, there will be no further need to pray.\"\n\nSteve Silberman was an apprentice of Allen Ginsberg at Naropa Institute in 1977 and lives in San Francisco."
