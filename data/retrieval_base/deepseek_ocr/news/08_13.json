For people over 60 years old, the toll could have doubled.\n\nSome of the measures include measures in health care, more widespread anti-coagulation and more public healthcare measures like people indoor and hydrated during extreme temperatures.\n\n“We need to consider climate change as a health issue,” said Elisa Giald, the lead author of the study, and a postdoctoral researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, a nonprofit research center. “We still have health costs of deaths and work lost every year, and we still have to be cautious. And we have to work with the public.”\n\nCouting deaths from extreme heat is difficult, a part because death certification and early surveillance could help avoid public mortality, said the lead author. The study reached 70 countries, including 28 that did not. The study provided valuable information, including 25 countries, protecting 48,000 lives, including 15,000 from heat-related deaths.\n\nThe researchers used an epidemiological model to analyze the deaths’ associated 2023 weekly heat records of deaths outside a country’s borders.\n\n“We’re quickly approaching the limit of what we can do,” said the study’s lead author, Carlos A. Velez, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who was not involved in the study, as the latest confirmed case in the study was a “new case” against the clock.\n\n“We’re not going to be able to mitigate the heat,” said Carlos A. Velez, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, whose work was not involved in the study, as the latest confirmed case in the study was a “new” case against the clock.\n\n**Continued on Page A8**\n\n![](images/0.jpg)\n\n\nRed Cross workers distributing water in Rome last summer.\n\n# Gamer Livestreamed Troubles To Psychiatrist. Was It Ethical?\n\n**By ELLIE BARRY**\n\nA few minutes into his first livestream conversation with Psychiatrist, Dr. Aki Kanjika gets casual with one of the guys. This was not a therapy session.
