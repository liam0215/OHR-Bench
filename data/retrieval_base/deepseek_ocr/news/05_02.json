It ended Wednesday, leaving rates at a more than two-decade high, where they have been set since 1961. Central bankers reiterated that they needed “greater consistency” that inflation was coming down before reducing rates.\n\n“Bundling on inflation have been a slow experience,” Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said at a news conference after the release of the central bank’s rate decision.\n\nThe Fed stands at a complicated crossroads: After months of rapid cooling, inflation has cooled surprisingly quickly in early 2024. The Fed’s preferred approach uses longer-term interest rates to slow demand, but it’s 21 percent high since its current 12 percent high in 2021, and even after Fed’s 12 percent rate hike, the Fed’s 2 percent goal. That calls into question how soon and how much officials will be able to remain confident rates.\n\n“What we’ve said is that we need tighter financial conditions” that will allow the Fed to raise interest rates, said Ben Sirak, a former Fed economist who is now at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe Fed raised interest rates to avoid the risk of a sharp drop in inflation, but the Fed’s decision to keep rates steady was driven by the expectation that the economy is slowing down, which would in turn help to slow inflation and dampen the impact. Fed rate cuts in the past, including a 25 basis point cut in September, were followed by a 25 basis point cut in October.\n\nContinued on Page A13\n\n# INSPIRE A NAVY SUBMARINE NAVIGATING THE ARCTIC\n\n![](images/0.jpg)\n\n\nThe U.S. 5.1-megaton emergency found several feet of thick ice in the Arctic Ocean during a five-week expedition to aqua in researchers.\n\nA New York Times photographer onboarded a nuclear-powered attack sub to see how the Pentagon is training for a potential war below the frozen sea.

Martha McSally.\n\nTwo Republicans who broke with their party’s leadership on the issue said they were disappointed by the outcome.\n\nThough a New Jersey native, the senator suddenly joined with the party’s thin majority of backers, which was a clearout of power in the state, which is now a particularly Brooklyn, where voters are 18% and the east side of the city is the most diverse.\n\nAs his resignation grew, McSally came before a second Senate panel of Brooklyn’s rich literary past, and as well as an immigration case, a governor of swindlers who fled Brooklyn in the early 1990s to avoid prosecution.\n\n“The university has been a great place for me to learn and grow,” he said, adding that he had provided people in greater need and that people depended on a quarter of a U.S. congressional seats in recent years.\n\n“I’m very grateful to my family for the support of the U.S. Congress and the people of Arizona,” he said.\n\n# BY RICK REAVLEY AND ELIZABETH DIAZ\n\nContinued on Page A10\n\n# BY RICK REAVLEY AND ELIZABETH DIAZ\n\nContinued on Page B10\n\n# BY RICK REAVLEY AND ELIZABETH DIAZ\n\nContinued from Page A10\n\n# BLINKEN PRESSES HAMAS TO ACCEPT TERMS FOR TRUCE\n\nSEVENTH MIDEAST VISIT\n\nDemanding That Israel Have a Plan to Protect Civilians in Gaza\n\nThe article is by Edward Wong, Adam Ringer and Thomas Fuller.\n\nJERUSALEM — Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered twin messages to Hamas and Israel on Wednesday, pressing Israel to accept a cease-fire proposal that is the same time as Israel launched airstrikes in Gaza in the first week of the conflict.\n\nOn the last day of a Middle East trip, his seventh visit to the region since the war began in October, Mr. Blinken met with top U.S. representatives from Hamas.\n\n“We are determined to get a cease-fire that brings the hostages home and gets it done, and the only reason that that wouldn’t be achieved is because of Hamas,” Mr. Blinken said at the start of a meeting at Tel Aviv with senior leaders. He repeated the refrain, “There is a proposal on the table, and as we’ve said,” he said, “we’re on the same page.”\n\nThe message was a clear signal for the release of 34 hostages and the release of a cease-fire, and he would lead the release of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails.\n\nMr. Blinken’s comments, which were made in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, were in line with the Biden administration’s push for a cease-fire in Gaza, which the administration says is a win for the Palestinian people and a win for Israel.\n\n“There is a proposal on the table, and as we’ve said, we’re on the same page,” Mr. Blinken said. “We’re on the same page, and we’re on the same page.”\n\nThe Biden administration’s message was a clear signal for the release of 34 hostages and the release of a cease-fire in Gaza, which the administration says is a win for the Palestinian people and a victory for Israel.\n\nThe administration also made clear that the expected next front Israel, Wednesday, was a “clear and clear” message that Israel is ready to move forward with the next phase of its military campaign, which is expected to begin in the coming weeks.\n\nContinued on Page A15\n\n# PAUL AUSTER, 1947-2024\n\n# Postmodernist Who Embodied Rich Literary Past of Brooklyn\n\nBy ALEX WILLIAMS\n\nPaul Auster, the prolific novelist, memoirist and environmentalist, is more than a few books with postmodern readjustment of the past.
