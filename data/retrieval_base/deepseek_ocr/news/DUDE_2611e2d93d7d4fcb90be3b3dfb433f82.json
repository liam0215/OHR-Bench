    "text": "First Eastbay Rapid Transit\n\nBy HARRE W. DEMORO\nTribune Staff Writer\n\"The essential feature of rapid transit is to keep moving.\"\n\nThis is not advice from the builders of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, who promises to have trains running in the Eastbay in 1971.\n\nIt was printed in 1906 on the back of a timetable of the San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose Railway, the Eastbay's first rapid transit system.\n\nThe company, known to generations of commuters as the \"Key System\" went into business 60 years ago. The event, recalled today by only a handful of historians, occurred on October 28, 1903.\n\nThe plans and promises of the Key System were just as advanced and enthusiastic as those promoted today by BART. But it only took eight years to build the Key System. BART may need it.\n\nThe company was backed by Francis Marion \"Borax\" Smith, who came to Oakland before the turn of the century after making a fortune in the borax business.\n\nSmith quickly began gaining control of local trolley lines and planned to build a gigantic empire of transit, property and utility companies. His Realty Syndicate combine was one of the largest landowners in Alameda County.\n\nElectric railways were being built all over the country and Smith and his associates were mindful of the experience of real estate interests in other cities. It was a common and successful practice to buy property and then build trolley lines to it, raising the value of the land and making rich men out of the promoters.\n\nThe Smith interests believed that the Eastbay would prosper, and therefore so would their ventures, if there was fast train service to San Francisco. The Southern Pacific ran ancient steam-powered trains to ferry piers in Oakland and Alameda.\n\nThe San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose Railway was formed to compete with the SP. The company was to operate fast ferries between San Francisco and the Eastbay. Passengers would transfer to speedy electric trains taking them to Eastbay cities, and to San Jose.\n\nThe San Jose line was never built. But Smith succeeded in developing a modern ferry system and a network of electric interurban lines in the Eastbay.\n\nHis first venture was to Berkeley, where commuters had long been unhappy over SP service. Residents and merchants along Shattuck Avenue were less than enthusiastic about the smoky steam locomotives.\n\nThe ferry pier was built at the end of a long trestle stretching almost to Yerba Buena Island. Rails were laid along Adeline Street and Shattuck Avenue to University Avenue in downtown Berkeley. The route between University and Shattuck avenues to Alcatraz Avenue and Adeline Street is the exact path being used today by BART.\n\nService to Berkeley began on October 26, 1903. The modern electric cars in their flashy orange paint scheme and the ultra-modern ferries lured many customers from the SP. The Key System had trouble finding room for all of the passengers. Soon, Smith extended service to other areas, and the SP was forced to electrify its lines, which evolved into the \"Red Train\" system.\n\nService on 40th Street to a station at 41st Street and Piedmont Avenue began in 1904. A line to Grand Avenue and Broadway opened in 1906, followed by service to the Claremont Hotel in 1908, and north Berkeley and Albany in 1911.\n\nTrains did not operate into downtown Oakland on a permanent basis until 1917. City officials objected to operation of long trains on 12th Street. Until special rolling stock was obtained streetcars shuttled passengers from a train terminal in west Oakland into the downtown area.\n\nSmith interests owned the Claremont Hotel and also the long-vanished \"Key Route\" Inn, a hotel similar in appearance to the Claremont. It was built over the train tracks at Grand Avenue and Broadway. Smith and his associates lost control about 1912, but several major extensions were made later: to the Trestle Glen district in 1917, and into Piedmont in 1924. Other ex"
