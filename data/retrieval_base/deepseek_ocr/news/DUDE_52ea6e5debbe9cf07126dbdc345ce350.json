    "text": "SUNDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1949\n\nThe New York Times\n\nWinner of Brooklyn Institute 1949 Award Prowess Ability as Pianist at Town Hall\n\nBy NOEL STRAUS\n\nRemarkable gifts as musicians and technicians were made known by Lilian Kallir, 37-year-old pianist, who gave her first New York recital yesterday afternoon at Town Hall. Looking even younger than her age, and blessed with a charming stage presence, Miss Kallir captivated her large audience with a series of performances so poised and controlled, so replete with insight and imagination, that she already presented well on the way toward an important career.\n\nBorn in Prague, of Austrian parents, Miss Kallir, who arrived in this country three years ago and is now an American citizen, won the 1949 American Artistic Award of the Cleveland Institute of Arts and Sciences. Her playing yesterday was completely self-effacing, since and wholeness. It was, moreover, unassuming, sensitive, poetic and completely refined. Miss Kallir knew how to shape a phrase, give her interpretation clear architectural design, and apply it to the masterly fashion.\n\nPushed Deeply Into Style\n\nEven more to her credit was her ability to groble deeply into the meaning and style of her varied offerings and project the message of the music across the Technologies with the full measure of temperament and inborn feeling such artistry entails.\n\nNew York Journal-American\n\nBy Arthur Berger\n\nLilian Kallir, seventeen-year-old pianist, stirred a large audience to very enthusiastic applause at her New York debut recital yesterday afternoon at Town Hall. Miss Kallir's listeners were prepared in advance for someone of more than ordinary talents, for, as winner of the 1949 American Artistic Award, she has the distinction of being included on the season's major series of the Brooklyn Academy of Music with top-flight artists. The confidence, efficiency, gestures of fingers, and acrobatic facility with which she dispatched her debut program yesterday afternoon were such that one could easily see how Miss Kallir would impress a board of experts judges. This was absolutely prize-winning playing—playing unperturbed by the indecisions and inhibiting of older pianists when self-consciousness sets in.\n\nLilian Kallir gave promise of great things in her Town Hall debut on Saturday. At 17 she disclosed an artistry quite exceptional for a ten-year-giant.\n\nHer imaginative insight and her power to communicate feeling gave her performance as an air of distinction. She made it evident that she is worth hearing now.\n\nAnd the Brooklyn Academy of Music\n\n...the play, with the meaning and style of her varied offerings and project the message of the music across the Technologies with full measure of temperament and inborn feeling such artistry entails.\n\nEXCLUSIVE MANAGEMENT IN THE SOUTH\n\nAlkahest Celebrity Bureau\n\nHerman Rosen, President\n\nGUE\n\nN. Y.\n\n1222 Peachtree St., N.E."
