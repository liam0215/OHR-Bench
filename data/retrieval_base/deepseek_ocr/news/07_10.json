VOGEL\n\nWASHINGTON — In a nationally broadcast interview on Monday, President Biden poured back on to CBS. Responding who wants him to end his reelection campaign, saying, “I don’t care what the millions think.”\n\nSmall donors, he made clear, were coming through for him.\n\nBut how much Mr. Biden played a private call with his top donors and fund-raiser to reassure them. “It matters,” he told them of their support.\n\nThe seemingly contradictory messages about the conundrum facing the president as he grapples with the fallout from his disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump last month, in order to continue to fund his presidential campaign, Mr. Biden will most likely need the support of wealthy Democratic Party backers, the key donors who finance the slanted views calling for him to end his bid for reelection.\n\nIn trying to debate their opposition, Mr. Biden got a positive push on his legal relief on the party’s behalf, including his bid to campaign as a hand-off supporter by a longtime associate message. But, in some ways, even though Trump has been a major poll winner, he was the party will lose the White House and other major offices if he cuts short on his campaign.\n\n“We are with Biden,” Trump’s chief strategist, Brian J. Clifford, said. “Chris Scarborough said that the White House is going to shut down if they don’t get the order.”\n\n“The voters — and the voters — decide the number of times they want to be a candidate,” he said. “The number of times they want to be a candidate, not the number of times they want to be a candidate, not the number of times they want to be.”\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Monday, Mr. Biden said, “I’m getting to frustration by the timing of the election. I’m getting to frustration by the timing of the election. I’m getting to frustration by my own timing.”\n\n“I’m with Joe,” Senator Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday.\n\n“I’m with Joe,” Senator Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday.\n\n“I’m getting to frustration by the timing of the election.
