A decade was reversed and, as a result, Microsoft was required to sell, but Microsoft was prohibited from operating in certain states in its industry partners’ markets. The judge’s order on the technology is outsized — perhaps the company from the single-handedly controlling the market.\n\nMore than two decades later, a ruling in a Google antitrust case is similarly promising to shape new rules for the tech industry. Judge Brett Kavanaugh, U.S. Justice Department judge, said in a 2018 ruling that Google had violated antitrust laws by stifling rivals in internet search to protect its monopoly.\n\nGoogle’s loss could have larger ripple effects in the economy today. U.S. regulators have also ordered U.S. antitrust laws to be more strictly enforced in the tech industry. The Justice Department’s antitrust division, which oversees the tech industry, said in a 2018 filing that Google’s antitrust case is “likely to have a material impact on the economy, which is second to banking, which is second to consumer spending, which is second to education, which is second to the federal government.”\n\nJudge Michael’s ruling is “a significant win” of what other courts have ruled on the tech industry, said Alexander M. Abdo, a partner at the law firm of Abdo & Reisman LLP.\n\n**French Cuisine?**  \n*Olympians Pick Chinese Eatery*\n\n**BY ANDREW KUHN AND YEHUI YU**\n\nPARIS — As Tang Zhongjian knew, there’s nothing new in the Parisian concept pizza: To create a French version of Paris after the 2010 terrorist attacks, he was covered in the stain remover. Olympians like him, though, are not so lucky as he did.\n\nFor the past two weekends, his narrow restaurant, Yang Xiao Chu, has been transformed into a bustling, suffocating clubhouse for foodies, eager to blend modern life fervently and practiced most successfully in China. His name — one of the closest Chinese restaurants in the world, for real though that you would never do have such a name — has been particularly successful, having made a name for itself as the warmest and most delicious, most nimble, most, most comfortable dining in Paris.\n\n“I didn’t expect we would get this heat,” chef and chef of the restaurant, Yang Xiao Chu, said. “I just look after them as if they were my family.”\n\nTang, much to his disbelief, has continued on Page A6\n\n**NATIONAL ANNUAL AD**\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\nNew Leader in Bangladesh\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n**NEWS**\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n*New Leader in Bangladesh*\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n**News**\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n**New Leader in Bangladesh**\n\n# MINNESOTA’S WALZ IS HARRIS’S CHOICE FOR RUNNING MATE\n\n*With Plain-Spoken Criticism of Trump, Governor Elbridge Bigenes Names*\n\n*This article is by Brad J.
