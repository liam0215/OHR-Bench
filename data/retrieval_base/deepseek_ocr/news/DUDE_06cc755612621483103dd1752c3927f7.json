    "text": "The new Center for Imaging Science will be named for Chester F. Carlson, inventor of the technology for office copiers and a longtime supporter of RIT. The announcement was made Friday, Oct. 21, at a dinner hosted by Xerox Corporation to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Carlson’s invention, the process called “xerography” that creates dry copies of documents.\n\nProvost Thomas R. Plough noted in making the announcement that imaging science will characterize a world leadership academic programming thrust of RIT. “This nationally needed and unique teaching and applied research activity in imaging science, housed within the walls of this new facility, will serve as a fitting memorial to the genius of Chester F. Carlson,” he said.\n\nWhen completed in the fall of 1989, the Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science will be the largest academic facility of its kind in North America. Including both classrooms and research facilities, it is designed to serve as an international resource for the imaging community.\n\n“As a scientist-humanitarian, Chester F. Carlson gave the world a process that has revolutionized the distribution of information,” said President M. Richard Rose. “Xerography, a cornerstone of imaging science, has led to applications that have expanded mankind’s knowledge and improved our standard of living in fields as diverse as electronic printing and xerodiagnography for medical diagnosis.”\n\nDuring his lifetime, Carlson was a member of the Nathaniel Rochester Society and an active supporter of RIT as well as other universities and charities, often making donations anonymously. He died in 1968.\n\n“Although my husband prized his anonymity, I feel he would be proud that RIT chose to name its Center for Imaging Science for him,” said Mrs. Dorris Carlson, his widow. “A very large portion of his fortune went to various universities and colleges because he felt education of our young people was so vital to the individual and to the future of our country.”\n\nAs a young lawyer and physicist living in Queens in the 1930s, Carlson was frustrated by the costly and time-consuming methods then used to copy documents. He theorized that the phenomena of electrostatics and photoconductivity could be used to produce dry copies of printed materials. On Oct. 22, 1938, he and his assistant produced an image on a zinc plate, which he transferred to wax paper, creating a xerographic copy.\n\nAlthough more than 20 companies turned down his idea, telling him it could not be commercialized, the concept was bought by The Haloid Company of Rochester. The copier became such a stunning success that Haloid renamed itself in recognition of its greatest product. Today, it is Xerox Corporation.\n\n“Chester Carlson is one of the true pioneering giants of imaging,” said Rodney Shaw, director of the Center for Imaging Science. “The timeliness of his invention and the technical evolution it has fostered in the past 50 years are a major reason for the existence of the Center for Imaging Science.”\n\n---\n\n**Robert Downie to Lead Graphic Arts Campaign**\n\nRobert H. Downie, an RIT trustee and president of R.H. Downie Development Inc., an imaging research and investment company in Kenmore, N.Y., will serve as the new chairman of RIT’s $30 million Graphic Arts Capital Campaign. The fundraising initiative, part of RIT’s $100 million “Access to the Future” capital campaign, will help strengthen the international leadership role of the School of\n\n**Soccer Team Heads To NCAA Playoffs**\n\nFor the seventh straight year, the RIT men’s soccer team will compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III soccer playoffs.\n\nSeeded first in the New York State region, RIT hosts number four, State University of New York (SUNY) at Binghamton, at 1 p.m., Sunday, Nov. 6. The other first round regional contest pits number three, Alfred University at number two, Clarkson University, at 2 p.m., Saturday, Nov. 5. Date and site for the regional championship will be determined after the first matches.\n\n*continued on page 2*\n\nPrinting Management and Sciences by increasing student scholarships, endowed faculty chairs, and state-of-the-art facilities.\n\nRonald A. White served as campaign chairman until September, when he was named interim director of RIT’s Center for Newspaper Operations. Downie has been co-chairman of the campaign’s Industry Executive Steering Committee since September 1987.\n\nPresident M. Richard Rose has stated that “the capital campaign will help keep RIT on the cutting edge of emerging technologies. Our progress in shaping the way students learn about the graphic arts will influence the industry for generations.”\n\nThe graphic arts capital campaign, which will focus on industry support, will provide $10 million for endowed professorships, $8 million for scholarships in printing, newspaper production, and magazine publishing; $10 million for equipment; and $2 million for library funds to support new programs. Research activities and joint programs with industry are also expected to increase as a result of the campaign.\n\nDownie, with more than 40 years of experience in the graphic arts industry, was vice president and general manager of Moore Business Form Research Center, Grand Island, N.Y., and vice president and general manager of the Kidder Press Company in Dover, N.H. He was senior vice president of corporate development of Moore Corporation in Toronto and was the founder and first president of International Imaging Material Inc., Amherst, N.Y.\n\nAwarded patents for printing, converting, and graphic arts equipment and processes, Downie was elected a member of the Society of Fellows of the Graphic Arts Technical Foundation in 1971 in recognition of his contributions to the graphic arts.\n\n---\n\n**Tigers Blast N.D.; To Host Tourney**\n\nUnder first-year coach Buddy Powers, the men’s hockey team makes its first home start tomorrow with the eighth annual RIT Tournament. In first round action Friday, Holy Cross faces off against Babson at 4:30 p.m. The host Tigers meet University of Connecticut at 7:30 p.m.\n\n“We have an excellent field, and there should be some fierce competition for the championship,” said Powers. “We’re a veteran squad with a lot of offensive power, good experience on defense, and tremendous goal tending.”\n\nRIT opened its season last weekend, splitting a doubleheader at Notre Dame. The Tigers captured the first contest, 8-3, and lost the second, 3-2, in overtime. “We want to get back on top in the ECACs (Eastern College Athletic Conference) and return to the NCAAAs,” commented *continued on page 2*"

    "text": "# PROFILE\n\n# Jeff Meredith Assistant Director for Parking and Special Events Campus Safety\n\nCampus Safety’s Jeff Meredith may be the assistant director for parking and special events, but even he has gotten RIT parking tickets. But, he hastens to add, they were written back in the days when he was an RIT student, studying criminal justice at night while holding down a full-time job in security at Monroe Community College and raising a family.\n\n“And I always paid my tickets,” he laughs. “I was never a flagrant offender but there were times I was in a hurry for class and parked illegally on the lawn.”\n\nThese days, though, Meredith has a “clean record.” He sympathizes with those people circling the parking lots for a spot because he has turned down special parking permits and hunts like any other RIT staff member.\n\nThis year the hunt is taking longer, because new construction projects have cut down on regular parking spots. Complaints about parking have been numerous — and some are directed to Meredith, so he has made the rounds, explaining policies and problems to both student and staff groups.\n\n“There are no secrets in parking. People can see what’s going on,” he said. “Everyone can point to me and say, ‘he’s the one,’ but I just explain the situation and they can see no one person is to blame.”\n\nSuch a conciliatory attitude is appropriate for a police officer, which is what Meredith originally planned, even attending the City of Rochester Police Academy. Instead, he decided to work more directly in crime prevention and with youth and joined RIT.\n\n“A lot of the skills required on my job are the same as those required of a police officer: confidence in your ability and communication skills,” Meredith said.\n\n# STATISTICS\n\n# Polls RIT Students\n\nIf RIT students have their say, the next president of the United States will be George Bush, in a fairly close race.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted Oct. 17-21 by RIT’s Statistics Club, Vice President Bush is favored over Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, 53 to 47 percent. Results were released Oct. 27.\n\nOther results include:\n\n• 57 percent of the students claim they are likely to vote Nov. 8.\n\n• By a margin of 51 to 26 percent, with 23 percent undecided, RIT students think the Republican Party will do a better job of keeping the country prosperous.\n\n• By a margin of 36 to 31 percent, with 33 percent undecided, RIT students think the Republican Party is more likely to keep the United States out of World War III.\n\n• By a margin of 66 to 7 percent, with 27 percent undecided, RIT students think the Democratic Party cares more for the less fortunate.\n\n• 39 percent say they are Republicans, 38 percent are Independents, and 23 percent are Democrats.\n\n• 40 percent of the RIT students say they are middle-of-the-road, 32 percent call themselves liberal, and 28 percent are conservative.\n\nAccording to Dr. James Halavin of the Department of Mathematics and advisor to RIT’s Statistics Club, “Results are based on 254 responses out of 804 survey questionnaires mailed out to full-time students in all of RIT’s full-time colleges.”\n\nHe adds, “The sampling tolerance for findings based on the total sample is plus or minus nine percentage points.”\n\n# Co-op’s Beverly Gburski Honored by Girl Scouts\n\nBeverly Gburski, director of RIT’s Office of Cooperative Education and Placement, has been awarded the 1988 Girl Scout Salute to Excellence Award. The awards recognize current or former members of the Girl Scouts who have distinguished themselves through career achievement or volunteer service.\n\nGburski has been involved with the Girl Scout organization for more than 20 years, both as a troop member and as a Brownie and Junior Girl Scout leader. “This award is special to me because scouting was one of the most positive influences on my life,” said Gburski. “Because of the Girl Scouts, I was able to travel, develop my leadership and communications skills, and meet women who became role models for me.\n\n“The co-op experience gives many RIT students the same opportunities that Girl Scouting offered me,” Gburski noted. “They’re able to get a ‘window on the world’ and learn things they may not have been able to otherwise.”\n\nDirector of RIT’s co-op program for more than four years, Gburski oversees a staff of 30. Her leadership has been vital to the growth of the program, which now serves more than 3,000 students and is the fifth largest in the world.\n\nEarlier this year, Gburski was named chairperson of the Cooperative Education Division of the American Society for Engineering Education. She is only the second woman to hold that post since the group’s 1926 inception.\n\n# Soccer Team...\n\ncontinued from page 1\n\n# RIT Men’s Hockey Schedule\n\nFri.

    "text": "Lying on a bed of 2,000 nails is not the way to a good night’s sleep, but is useful in explaining the principle of inertia, which states that a body at rest tends to stay at rest. The bag of sand, or “granulated inertia” as Winston calls it, on his chest absorbs the force, or kinetic energy, of the sledgehammer so that he isn’t hurt.\n\n# He Nails Home the Point\n\nLying on a bed of nails while someone swings a sledgehammer at the cement block balanced on his head doesn’t faze Doug Winton. Nor does driving a nail through a board with his hand, karate chopping a stack of wood, or cracking a board over his forehead. Though his audience shudders, Winton knows he’s protected by the laws of physics.\n\n“The Amazing Winton” performed these and other bizarre feats for his CCE physics class on October 22 in an eye-popping demonstration to explain such scientific principles as kinetic energy, inertia, and velocity.\n\n“I’ve had students who couldn’t stand to look,” says Winton, who’s taught science to adult, part-time students at RIT for 15 years. Indeed, many that day held their breath, covered their eyes and expressed relief as he completed each stunt without injury. During Spring Quarter one student was so concerned that he offered the instructor a ride home—or to the hospital.\n\n“I’ve gotten quite a reputation,” Winton says. “I’ve had people I don’t know show up in my class. One guy even brought the neighbor’s kids.”\n\nWinton’s students say they love his “wacky” sense of humor and call him one of the best teachers they’ve ever had. Winton seems to get as much pleasure as they do from the class. “I would have ‘burned out’ long ago from just standing up and lecturing them. It’s more fun to teach this way.”\n\n# Athletes Inducted Into Hall of Fame\n\nThe 20th annual RIT Sports Hall of Fame induction dinner takes place tonight. Thursday, Nov. 3, at the Rochester Hilton. The dinner and induction ceremonies will follow a reception at 6:30.\n\nSelected for induction are former fencer Ron Bambas (Printing, 1961), the late football player Paul Isbell (Printing, 1974), swimmer/softball player Debbie Dourlain Callegari (Printing, 1983), and wrestler Darrell Leslie (Food Administration, 1983).\n\nBambas, president of Rainbow Graphics in Yorba Linda, Calif., was RIT’s first All-American in any sport. He compiled a 103-38 record and placed sixth in the 1959-60 NCAAAs. Isbell, who died in a boating mishap in 1976, was a premier defenseman. He made 319 tackles in three seasons, including a phenomenal 28 against St. Lawrence in 1974. He was a three-time Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) weekly all-star.\n\nIn two seasons of swimming Callegari earned 10 All-American honors and six New York State titles and scored 791 career points. In softball, she played first base and hit .350. Leslie, a four-time All-American, wrestled his way to a national title in 1983. During his career he won 108 matches and lost only 15. He was named 1983 Senior Male Athlete of the Year. He is now a materials handler at St. Mary’s Hospital in Rochester.\n\nSTUDENT VOLUNTEERS...College of Business students enrolled in Freshman Seminar, which introduces first-year students to study techniques and other skills, packed and delivered boxes of food to a dozen of Rochester’s elderly. Oct. 13, as part of the seminar’s commentary component, Freshman Seminar, a 10-week program of the Student Affairs Division and the College of Business, began last year.\n\n# Campus Safety Says ‘Secure PC is Happy’\n\nContact the Campus Safety loss prevention specialist (-6989) for more information on how to protect your computers and other valuable office equipment.\n\n# RIT*FIT Schedules Employee Testing\n\nRIT*FIT testing for faculty and staff is scheduled for Thursday, Dec. 8. The session will include assessment of blood pressure, cholesterol, lung volume, body fat, and strength and flexibility.\n\nThe testing is available by appointment through the Physical Education Office at 475-5972.\n\n# Students to Compete For Management Scholarships\n\nThe printing industry’s blue-collar image, dated by a series of technological revolutions that require management as well as technical skills, is fading reluctantly.\n\nThe reality of printing as a booming industry filled with professional positions for college graduates is getting a boost from RIT’s School of Printing Management and Sciences. The faculty has challenged its sophomore students to compete for a $5,000 scholarship, which will be applied toward the winner’s senior tuition. Students who choose to enter the 15-month competition, which began last month for the Class of 1991, will present papers aimed at the graphic arts industry and its increasing management demands.\n\n“The competition will underscore our commitment to management education by preparing our students for an industry that demands professional leadership,” said Miles Southworth, director of the school.\n\n# Computer Creates Hybrid Art Style\n\nImagine an image created by Leonardo Da Vinci and Andy Warhol...Albrecht Durer and Ansel Adams...Man Ray and Monet. Using his own and a research partner’s work, Robert Keough is producing just such hybrid images.\n\nKeough, professor of graphic design in the College of Fine and Applied Arts, is a printmaker. Photographer Michael Teres, RIT lecturer in graphic design, is Keough’s partner. With the help of a computer, they are combining traditional disciplines to create new art forms. The process begins with computer analysis of Keough’s and Teres’s individual pieces to identify the elements of each man’s style. With the source material thus generated, they can mix the computer images to create hybrid works of art. The resulting pieces combine both men’s styles and the qualities inherent in both printmaking and photography. “Because of the power of the computer,” says Keough, “we can come up with a homogenous work.”\n\nA grant for interdisciplinary studies from the Rockefeller Foundation/National Endowment for the Arts, administered by Hallwalls, Buffalo, will help the researchers produce a show of prints.\n\n“The competition will encourage students to understand concepts and integrate material from separate courses. It will also inspire them to pursue further management study and will give the faculty a reading on the effectiveness of the second-year printing management concepts courses.”\n\n“The competition will underscore students to understand concepts and integrate material from separate courses. It will also inspire them to pursue further managemen\n\nThe RIT Center for the Arts and the College of Business are sponsoring the event.\n\n“The competition will underscore students to understand concepts and integrate material from separate courses.

A giant timepiece designed by Wendell Castle, artist-in-residence, School for American Craftsmen, will be unveiled at the corner of Yonge and Bloor streets, one of the country’s busiest intersections.\n\nThe clock—named “Full Moon”—features a huge, antique bronze face, three-foot, gold-leafed hands, and a supporting arch tall enough for pedestrians to walk under. “When people say ‘meet me under the clock,’ they’ll be able to do just that,” said Castle.\n\nThe creation of the 19-foot-tall clock was commissioned by Hammerson Canada, Inc., one of Canada’s largest real estate companies, for the exterior of Two Bloor Street West, a Hammerson-owned office building. “The piece should prove to be a Toronto landmark,” said Hammerson spokesperson Grace McQuaid.\n\nThe timepiece is expected to be unveiled at the end of November.\n\nSCHOLARSHIP AWARDED...College of Business MBA students Derek Case, second from right, is this year’s winner of the Emerson Scholarship, awarded annually to an RIT graduate student. With him, from left, are Dr. William Mibai, chairman of graduate programs, College of Business; Paul Bernstein, dean of graduate studies; and Dr. Walter F. McCanna, College of Business dean."
