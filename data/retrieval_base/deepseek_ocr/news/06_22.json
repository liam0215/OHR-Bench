That new test has some confusion in the lower courts, with some judges rightly down laws that had been on the books for decades.\n\nThe case decided Friday, United States v. Kaban, marked a turning point. The case can now be considered in the lower courts, with the Supreme Court’s ruling on the right to carry a gun in the home now a matter of law, and a new test to assess all sorts of gun control laws, one that looked at historical practices to gauge their constitutionality. That new test has some confusion in the lower courts, with some judges rightly done laws that had been on the books for decades.\n\nThe case decided Friday, United States v.

That new test has some confusion in the lower courts, with some judges rightly\n\n“When a restraining order translates to a finding that an individual has a right to carry a gun in the home, it is a very physical safety of an intimate relationship,” said the lawyer who was in the lower court. “The court said that the court is in effect ‘the chief justice of the court,’ and the court is in effect ‘the chief justice of the court.’”\n\nThe Supreme Court on Page A9\n\n# New Editor at Washington Post\n\n# On Tape: Bid to Cement Israel’s West Bank Hold\n\n# Decline in Opinion Against Mutual\n\nBy BENJAMIN MILLER and KATIE ROBERTSON\n\nRobert Winter, the editor responsible for the Washington Post, has retired along with many other reporters raised questions about the paper’s continued allegiance to Israel.\n\nMr. Winter, 64, was the editor of the paper from 2001 to 2011, when he was the Washington Post’s deputy editor, according to a resignation letter he submitted to the Post on Friday.
