Though the presses were down, the record of the visit as it would have appeared in The Times is intact—in \"The Pope's Journey to the United States,\" a 160-page paperback published by Bantam Press 48 hours after the Pope returned to Rome.\n\nSeveral days before the Pope's arrival, Metropolitan Editor A. M. Rosenthal and Assistant Metropolitan Editor Arthur Gelb worked out the assignment schedule they would follow Oct. 4 if the paper was printing. When it became apparent that it would not be, the reporters, editors and photographers on the schedule were asked if they would cover the same assignments for Bantam. Their response, Abe Rosenthal said, was \"immediate, warm, professional.\"\n\nReporters and editors, Guild members and non-Guild members alike (the former with Guild approval) went to work in a make-shift city room on the second floor of the Bantam offices at Madison Avenue and 40th Street. The space, which ordinarily houses Bantam's production department, had been stripped of its regular furnishings. Long rectangular tables and chairs rented from a banquet supply service, served as desks. Typewriters, assembled from Bantam's bookkeeping department, were lined up on the tables and on any other flat space. The copy desk was set up in what is ordinarily the stock room; the editors' desk was in the handsomely carpeted office of Bantam's vice president in charge of production. Four rented TV sets were placed at strategic (Continued on Page 3)\n\nBack to Work In a Big Way\n\nThe Times roared back into action in late afternoon Oct. 10, after its giant machine had been silent for 24 days.\n\nMinutes after the pickets tore up their signs at 3:20 P.M. Sunday, the push was on for Monday's paper. Reporters were back at their typewriters; copy desks filled almost immediately; printers moved directly to their tasks. Advertising, circulation, production and news executives were ready with alternate plans for Monday's paper. They had layouts for a 96-page issue and for an 80-page. They decided, for mechanical and distribution reasons, to go with the 80-page layout. This meant that with a later-than-normal press start they could still get a bigger-than-normal press run. Had they chosen the 96-page paper to accommodate more advertising, the number of printed copies would have been proportionately reduced and would have come off the presses too late for delivery.\n\nThe original schedule had called for an 11 P.M. close in the composing room. But when so many printers showed up, in response to telegrams sent out by General Foreman George Lapolla, the target was advanced an hour.\n\nBy 6 P.M. the composing room was operating with almost double its normal Sunday night crew. To ease its burden, type for the four \"Catch-up\" pages bridging the strike period, and for 10 pages of classified ads had been set in advance in union job shops. Display advertisers had furnished their material in complete plate form, ready for publication except for being mounted on metal in the photo-engraving and stereo job shop. This made it possible for Mr. Lapolla to (Continued on Page 7)"

    "text": "**Scene: Times Staff Stars in Documentary**\n\n*Wide Window of Mr. Malone*  \nHeld Worthy of Oscar\n\n**By BOSLEY CROWTHER**\n\nThe agreeably poetic concept of the Times as a window through which the reader may scan the daily happenings of consequence throughout the world is neatly developed in the context of a dandy film about the making of The Times that George Pitt has put together under the title, \"The Wide Window of Mr. Malone.\"\n\nIt is essentially an informative picture, and in its 27 minutes running time, it gives the viewer a capsule comprehension of how this great newspaper is produced—how its far-flung correspondents diligently patrol their beats, gathering news and dispatching their stories and their interdepartmental observations to New York; and how the local staffs, editors and mechani-cal craftsmen assemble, arrange, compose and print the comprehensive publication that daily provides Mr. Malone with his window upon the world.\n\nBut it is this image of the paper as a window—as one of the several devices through which a person may look and obtain ever-widening information about everything of importance that goes on—that gives the picture its flip, the nice mechanical thrust that makes the busi-ness of producing a newspaper seem more important and dramatic and bold.\n\n*The editors assemble for the afternoon news conference.*\n\n**The Cast**\n\nTHE WIDE WINDOW OF MR.
