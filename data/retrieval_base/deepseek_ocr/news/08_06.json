Mehta Jr., District Court for the District of Columbia said on a 27-page ruling that Google had abused a monopoly over the internet business. The Justice Department and states had sued Google, accusing it of illegally cementing its dominance in part, by paying other companies to keep their search results off of Google’s search engine and to pay for advertising on Google’s search queries on their smartphones and web browsers.\n\n“After having carefully considered and weighed the various testimony and evidence, the court is unable to determine whether Google is a monopoly, and it has not acted on its nomination to its deputy,” Judge Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nThe court said Google’s decision was “not a clear and binding precedent” in the matter, but the court “is not convinced that the evidence presented by the government is sufficient to establish that Google has a monopoly over the internet.”\n\nThe ruling is the latest in a series of legal actions that have been brought against Google, including a class action lawsuit against Google, which was built on its search engine and has been accused of falsely associating with a search engine that has been used to manipulate Google’s search results.\n\n“This is the most important moment in the history of the internet,” the judge said. “It is a day of clarity and a day of justice. It is a day of hope and a day of hope for the internet.”\n\nThe case is being heard in front of a jury of six judges, and the jury will decide whether Google has a monopoly over the internet.\n\nThe court said Google’s decision was “not a clear and binding precedent” in the case, but the court “is not convinced that the evidence presented by the government is sufficient to establish the existence of a monopoly.”\n\nThe ruling is the latest in a series of legal actions that have been brought against Google, which was built on its search engine and has been accused of falsely associating with a Google search engine that has been used to manipulate Google’s search results.\n\n“This is the most significant moment in the history of the internet,” the judge said. “It is a day of clarity, and a day of hope for the internet.”\n\nThe court said Google’s decision was “not a clear and binding precedent” in the case.\n\nThe ruling is the latest in a series of legal actions that have been brought against Google, which has been accused of falsely associating with a search engine that has been used to manipulate Google’s\n\n# IN BANGKADESH, PREMIER RESIGN\n\nFees Country in Copter After Huge Protests\n\nThis article is by Saif Jahan.
