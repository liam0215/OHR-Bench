They include farm laborers and construction workers, but also people who may engage in work involving hazardous chemicals and cooks in commercial kitchens.\n\nThe measure would be the first major federal government regulation to protect American workers based on the job. And it is expected to meet off-the-shelf threats to some industries and regulatory groups, which oppose regulations that would, in some cases, require more breaks and access to water, aside and air conditioning.\n\nBut even if the rule takes effect, experts say, its governance and emergency response systems in poorly suited to meet the urgent needs of workers.\n\nLast year was the hottest on record for the United States, with a 1.5°F increase in average temperature and a 1.5°F increase in average temperature.
