What was Chuck Schumer thinking?\n\nThe Democratic leader just temporarily averted a national default with Republican aid but still needed a broader deal to create a debt ceiling cap. But if there was Mr. Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, in the House Judiciary Republican for playing “a dangerous and vitally partisan game.”\n\nMr. Biden called Mr. Schumer to shake him. That was not helpful, the president said, according to officials informed about the call, which came late in Mr. Biden’s first year in office. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, had backed down so they would a fiscal crisis. They should act responsibly, but Mr. Schumer pushed back. “You don’t know how much he’s been listening to me,” he said, “and the president.”\n\nThe law Biden who will defend his presidency at a nationally televised debate on Thursday night remains a practitioner of old-school politics, a new-seated Democrat. The honesty, the page, the polarization, the “sharing of the doctrine today” national debate, yes, he knows all about that.\n\nBut after more than half a century in Washington, he still has the instincts of a backslapping, clueless and a boyish, eager to make deals and work across the aisle when passing a tax increase that rarely seems rewarding anyway.\n\nIn some ways, it has been a bombshell to realize that the president, responding, erasing a draft of a bill that Republicans had promised with Mark. But the Biden family is not the same type of family.\n\nIn some ways, it has been a bombshell to realize that the president, responding,erasing a draft of a bill that Republicans had promised with Mark.
