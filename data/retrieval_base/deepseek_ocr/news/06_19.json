The rest of the time, it was being prepared after rough seas broke it apart, detached in about a month damage or paused because of security concerns.\n\nThe pier was never meant to be more than a staging area for humanitarian aid. Biden administration pushed Israel to allow more aid to be sent supplies into Gaza through land routes, at far more distant of security concern. But even the modest goals for the pier would be told later, some have taken military officials’ word.\n\nWhen the pier was conceived, health authorities were warning that authorities’ ways must be pre- pared of future, if recent events. Israel has given relief organizations a list of 10,000 people who could be stranded in the situation remains unclear.\n\nThe Biden administration initially predicted that it would be September before being strong again would make the pier operation viable until after early as now. But military advisers and organizations are saying that, as soon as early as next month, a looming deadline for the project is that they will have prepared Israel to handle the situation.\n\nPresident Biden ordered the U.S. military to begin building the pier in March, at a time when he met with the U.S. military’s top commanders to discuss the pier’s design and the need to move it to Israel’s main- land airport, the Erez.\n\nThe first truckloads of aid being moved along more than 20 miles of the pier, the project has strong political backing, while many Gazans are experiencing immense hunger, and the U.S. military has been working to get the pier built.\n\nThe pier last week before being moved because of high seas.\n\nThe pier last week before being moved because of high seas.\n\nThe pier last week before being\n\nThe pier last week before being\n\nThe pier last week before being\n\nThe pier last week before\n\nThe pier last week before\n\nThe pier last week before\n\nThe pier last week before\n\n# U.S. Gaza Pier Out of Service On Most Days\n\nCalled Failure, Project Could End\n\nBY JRILLEN COOPER\nWASHINGTON — The $239 million temporary pier that the US. military built on short notice to rush humanitarian aid to Gaza has largely failed in its mission,  \n\nThe pier was never meant to be more than a staging area for humanitarian aid.

The U.S. military has been working to prepare for a strike by Hamas, a group of Islamic militants, in recent weeks, with the goal of a full-scale invasion.\n\nIn a measure of the danger of a full-scale invasion, Israel has been building the most of its lines of defense in Gaza, and Lebanon, to Israel and to the United States, to prepare for a full-scale invasion.\n\nUnlike Hamas, the Palestinian militant fighting group in Gaza, the Hezbollah, has troops who are behind the border, and the group possesses long-range missiles. But the group’s range is limited, and the group’s leaders are not willing to risk the lives of their own people in Gaza, which is home to about 1.5 million Palestinians, according to the United Nations.\n\nBut as the fighting in recent days has started to slow, the war has hit a national crisis in Gaza, with Israel, and some Israeli leaders, saying that a national crisis in Gaza has hit a national crisis in Gaza, with Israel, and some Israeli leaders, saying that a\n\nBut as the fighting in recent days has started to slow, the war has hit a national crisis, and some Israeli leaders, saying that a national crisis in Gaza, with Israel, and some Israeli leaders, saying that a national crisis, and some Israeli leaders, saying that a national crisis, and some Israeli leaders, saying that\n\n# Strimulus Package Is a Political Jumble for Biden\n\nBY DAN HANSENLEY AND MARLENE NG\n\nWASHINGTON — The 15.9 trillion economic stimulus package that’s already Biden signed into law after taking office has left the U.S. economy and a nation of 330 million people in a recession.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan, which the Biden administration unveiled last month, passed in March 2021, has faced discontent from Democrats, who in part blame the package for the economic crisis.
