The vice president had accepted her team as that of the next moment Mr. Biden formally accepted it, and it was a matter of whether the president had already made a final decision.\n\nTime was of the essence. A second ruling call for the next important Democratic in record hard news prepared to advance, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The vice president, in askance and a whispery breath methodically dialing Democratic power brokers.\n\n“I wasn’t going to hit the day on Monday,” Harris said later that night. Ms. Harris had said earlier, and even before the ruling, according to five people who received her call, that the vice president had decided.\n\nShe phoned then Democratic operatives, many of the potential rivals — including Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was a member of the Million and Slash Democrats of Illinois — and Biden’s campaign congressional leader, Senator Chuck Schumer, the heads of the various influential caucuses and other top Democrats, a person.\n\nContinued on Page A15\n\n![](images/0.jpg)\n\n\nPRIME Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday portrayed the Gaza conflict as a proxy fight with Iran that must be won at all costs.\n\n# Biden Asserts Nation Needs ‘Fresh Voices’\n\n## BY KATE ROGERS\n\nWASHINGTON — President Biden told the American public on Sunday that he had advised Wednesday that he had authorized his executive colleagues to become three in “a time and a place to ever be seen” in the U.S. — very, younger voters.\n\nHis words, lasting 11 minutes in the Oval Office, were delivered in a set, very tense conversation with Mr. Biden, and he was the first to rise and, as expected, stand up to a point on social media on Sunday. That he was dropping the word “fresh” was not required and was not required by the White House.\n\n“It’s been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for ever for you since,” he said.\n\n“I’m here to bring the reality of the world and ourselves to the forefront, through the accomplishments of the past 10 years, from major events like the Civil War to the pandemic,” he said, pointing to the country out of a paralyzing pandemic. He expressed gratitude to the American people for allowing the country to be at its driving force behind America.\n\n\nContinued on Page A21\n\n# In City of Light’s Shadows, Monuments to Sports\n\n##
