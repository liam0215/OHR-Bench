In his company, SpaceX, is the primary provider of launch services to NASA and to the Pentagon. His rockets carry far more mass than satellites into orbit than any aerospace craft, including the two to low Earth orbit satellites that the U.S. government is operating from within its own space domain.\n\nBut one striking way, the former outside has come to interest the aerospace contractor because it once fought to topple it. In the end, things simply ran out, leaving SpaceX with only a few months of energy in which to keep operating, giving it a rush to keep its own launch site in secure locations, and a new one in a more unfamiliar location.\n\nThe new generation of space entrepreneurs trying to remain competitive is sufficiently concerned about what they see as an opportunity to work with the U.S. government and even now willing to take off the new and risky task.\n\nTim Ellis started Relativity Space and is now a partner at Musk’s pursuit of a rocket that could carry people to Mars. There he found both other innovative companies and a new market to explore: space travel trying to block his competitors from getting to space.\n\n“I’m not concerned with Mr. Musk and the launch of SpaceX but I do think there is a lot of value in building a company that can do that,” Ellis said. “I think that’s a good thing because SpaceX doesn’t have to compete with companies like SpaceX, which are based in the U.S. and have a lot of money to spend on research and development. They’re not going to have to compete with SpaceX.”\n\nPeter Beck, an aerospace engineer who lives in Dallas, Texas, in 2019 with Mr. Musk to talk about SpaceX, told Space.com that he called Robert L. Sowell, a former NASA chief, to ask about starting a company that could play a role in a new space domain. Mr. Beck said that Sowell’s company was interested in a new domain that was not in the U.S. and that he was interested in a new domain that was not in the U.S. and that he was interested to work with a company that could play a role in a new space domain. Mr. Beck said that Sowel’s company was interested in a new domain that was not in the U.S. and that Mr. Beck said that Sowell’s company was interested in a new domain that was not the U.S. and that he was interested in a new domain that was not in the U. and that he was interested in a new domain that was not in the U. and that Mr. Beck said that Sowell’s company was interested in a new domain.
