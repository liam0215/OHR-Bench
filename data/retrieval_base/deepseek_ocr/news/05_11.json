Biden’s efforts to jumpstart domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles and boost U.S. battery production could be underfoot by China, which has quickly ramped global markets with cheap solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles and other products.\n\nThe long-awaited tariffs are the latest in a flurry of new rounds of the Biden and former President Donald J. Trump imposed on imports from 530 billion of Chinese-made goods in 2021. Most of the Trump tariffs were on autos, but they also applied to cars, cellphones, laptops, and other products. The Biden administration has said the tariffs are intended to protect American workers, which currently face a 25% tax on imported cars. The administration is expected to raise that to 30% and 100 percent in order to make it prohibitively expensive to buy a Chinese EV.\n\nThe Biden administration has also been working to ensure that the U.S. electric vehicle industry is not harmed by the tariffs.
