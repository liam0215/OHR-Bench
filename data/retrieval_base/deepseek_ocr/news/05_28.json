The Israeli military said that 74 people were wounded in the attack.\n\nIn a speech to the Israeli Parliament on Monday, Mr. Netanyahu said the military had sought to protect noncombatants, by issuing a warning to the Israeli military about a civilian school that in Rafah and a military camp for “enemies.” Despite our supreme efforts to limit the number of civilians,” he said, “a tragic accident occurred to our regent last night.”\n\nHe accused Hamas of failing to protect the general population, and said: “For us, every unarmed, every Israeli, there is a tragedy. For Hamas, it’s a strategic mistake to be what different people are doing in Rafah.”\n\nA senior official said the military had warned the general population that it was not safe to remain in Rafah, the Gaza Strip, and that the Israeli military was taking steps to evacuate civilians.\n\nThe Israeli military said it could not be sure how many died, but the death toll was likely to climb if civilians were not evacuated.\n\nContinued on Page A10\n\n**BIDEN’S STRATEGY ON ELECTRIC CARS: KEEP CHINA’S OUT**\n\n**TARIFFS ON CHEAP ELS**\n\nWeighing Labor Support and Climate Fears in an Election Year\n\n**By JIM TANKERSLEY**\n\nWASHINGTON — President Biden wants more of America’s cars and tires to run on electricity, not gas. His administration has pushed that goal on multiple fronts, including strict new regulations at state emissions and vehicle sales subsidies to help American consumers make an match a $7,500 off the cost of a new electric vehicle.\n\nMr. Biden’s aides agree that electric vehicles — which currently more than $53,000 on average in the United States — would cut even faster were they were less expensive. As it happens, there is a wave of new electric vehicles significantly cheaper than the ones customers can currently buy in the United States. They are proving extremely popular in Europe.\n\nBut the president and his team do not want Americans to buy these cheap cars, which recall the number of auto recalls they’ve because they are made in China. The new electric vehicles are not low-cost imported electric vehicles — they are often driven on expensive overall, potentially helping the United States’ auto industry compete with a more familiar “low-cost” price competition.\n\nInstead, the president is taking a different approach. He is also, he has publicly expressed, to encourage action this month that will help the United States’ automakers.\n\nThose tariffs will put many potential cost discounts against consumers but could discourage car buyers in America. But Mr. Biden said, like the decision to impose tariffs, the United States has some American rivals who are not willing to work with a common sense. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio said that the United States should not be complicit on the Biden’s ban on Chinese cars.\n\nThe apparent clash between Congress and the Trump administration.\n\n**Continued on Page A15**\n\n**BY ISABEL KERSINER**\n\nJERUSALEM — With numerous condemnations mounting,\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu takingoffinstead on Monday that the killing of dozens of people at Palestinian a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah was “a clear, calculated,” but gave no sign of curbing\n\nThe deadly fire that erupted Sunday the encampment on Sunday after an earlier came at a time where Gaza’s delicate time for Israel, just days after the International Court of Justice postponed order the\n\nThe Israeli military said that the target of the strike in Rafah on Sunday was a Hamas compound,\n\nMr. Biden’s aides agree that electric vehicles — which currently more than $53,000\n\nThe Biden administration has pushed that goal on multiple fronts, including strict new regulations at state emissions and vehicle sales\n\n**BY JIM TANKERSLEY**\n\nWASHINGTON — President Biden wants more of America’s cars and\n\nMr. Biden’s aides agree that electric vehicles — which currently more than $53,000 in average in the United States — would cut even faster were they were less expensive.
