Carolina\n\nBy ADAM LIPTAK\n\nWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court cleared the way on Thursday for South Carolina to make using a congressional map that a lower court had deemed unconstitutional racial gerrymanders that resulted in the“bleeding” of the state. American voters’ from a district.\n\nThe conservative majority, by a 6-0-1 vote, returned the case to the lower court, handing a victory to Republicans by allowing them to maintain boundaries that helped make the district in question a party stronghold.\n\nThe immediate effect of the ruling is to be limited, as the court’s delay in ruling had already opened the path for voters elected to take part in the map. But the majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, will have an impact beyond the map, too. It will have an impact on the state’s political landscape, as the state’s political landscape, as the state’s political landscape, as the state’ s political landscape, as the state’ s political
