M. Grant—Dear Brother—Seven months we now elapsed since my last communication to our chief brother brother and President Willard Richards, seated; and as I learn that you have succeeded him in Los, I shall continue my correspondence with you, and we more enter the regions of description, relative to matters in the east. I desired to inform you of the press of affairs with us some months ago; but the unsettled state of our prospects was such that I could not do with any certainty. I have now just arrived from Burrah, where I have been for the last two months. Not being able to learn satisfactorily, the situation of matters there, I rather hurriedly came to the conclusion to go and see for myself.\n\nI will say that I am well, and have been so, since I left here though much exposed by sea and land. The ostensible reasons for my going to Burrah were partially, for the purpose of ascertaining the true situation of the people called \"Cereons,\" an account of which was forwarded to you by Mr. Lindington, besides many others coming from the same source, viz: the Missionary Baptists, have indeed no time to inquire into the state of the country. And besides, and I feel as though I could ransack the further-est corner of the earth, to find a people that would believe our testimony, and obey the gospel. But when I found the people called \"Cereons,\" they were in many respects like all other Catholics laboring under the accumulated traditions of several thousand years, which are so strong, they are not with their very existence, that it seems a thing almost impossible to make any trusted upon them, or raise their narrow minds, to the idea that there is a God besides theirs, who is in possession of knowledge and power. They suppose that we know nothing of the God whom we serve, only by fabulous legends, similar to their own.\n\nThe Burrahs I must say, as a people are far in advance of the Bengals; they don't manifest that crouching, crawling, servile spirit, which the Hindus possess. Besides, they are much fairer in complexion than the large majority of Hindus and in their features, they are another model altogether. There is a slight resemblance to be traced in their out-lines, between them and the Malays; but they more strongly resemble the inhabitants of Siam, Cochin-China, and the Celestial Empire. These three are more or less scattered all through the Burrah Empire, and can only be told from them by their dress, and sometimes by the mode of worship, but not always, for I have seen them and the Burrahs both worshiping at the same time and place. From the great similarity in their language, and many of their traditions, I strongly incline to the opinion that they have sprung from the same Tartar origin.\n\nIn statues, the Burrahs are not more than five feet eight or nine inches, the tallest of them, and have very peculiar habits prevailing amongst them, one of which is, they will not take animal life, or kill anything for their own use at all; they do however, catch and eat fish; this is the only animal food which they make use of, except the animal should dig, when they would have no scruples in eating it, it matters not what the disease might have been; this as a matter of course, makes the most part of their diet vegetables, in which may be included the leaves of trees, and jungle fruits the latter I am told is very abundant during its season. They also make a free use of narcotics, such as opium tobacco, and beet-nut; they are the most inveterate smokers I have ever seen; children, before they are weaned from the breast, often commence the use of the cigar.\n\nThe Burrahs cultivate the earth but to a limited extent. Their principal production is rice; but I am told in the upper parts of the country, about Ava, that some wheat is raised, of an inferior quality but it cannot be to any great extent. They live in poor miserable hovels, made of bamboo, and thatched with grass. They are set upon posts a few feet above the ground, and are often set over a sitting pond of water, where all the filth from the house and crop thrown out of the window falls upon the thatt purpose, and the foul effluvia which arises from the stinking cesspools is almost beyond endurance to a half civilized nose. Their wearing apparel, and everything which they use, is purely domestic, and there is no such thing as caste among them. You can find a loom in almost every house, and the cloth which they manufacture much resembles French Grenhags, or Scotch Plaid, and is very strong and serviceable. There are also large quantities of silk manufactured, but I did not see any of them at work; it is generally of a coarse quality, but very serviceable, and strong. For common apparel, the men wear single piece of cloth around the loins, and a purgha (cloth) around the head; they wear their hair long, and never shave; they pluck out their eyebrows. This is their every-day appearance.\n\nThe women are very singular in their costume; their dress consists of a single piece of cloth, which is nearly square, and a little more than reaches round them, with the open part in front; they draw the upper edge tightly around them, and the lower edge is hanging a little below the knees, after it is sufficiently tight, the outside corner is tucked under; this is a natural consequence, leaves the garment nearly all open before, and every time the wind blows, they whittle person is exposed. They do not seem to mind anything about it, and can not be prevailed upon to change their mode of dress. The women are much superior to the men, and as a general thing, are much fairer in complexion, and of a fine carriage, and very kind, civil, and courteous. There is none of that shy, sneaking, affected timidity, that characterizes the women of Bengal; they do all of the work in the house, and out of doors as well as in the house, but in the house, and out of doors as well as in the house, but in the house and out of doors as well as in the house, but in the house and out of doors, and in the house and out of doors, and in the house and out of
