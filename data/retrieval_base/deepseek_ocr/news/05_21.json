SANGER\n\nIn their three years in power, President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran and his equally hard-line foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, did everything they could to com­cal­date the “Kaz and Russia” against the United States and Israel.\n\nThey funded Hamas and Hezbollah, They arrested the Houthis, brought the militia into­tig­nance that had attacked an air­cargo ship in the Red Sea. They cracked down on dissent — more, launched airstrikes first direct missile attacks on Israel, after Israel killed two of Hamas’ oper­ants, and turned Iran into “the world’s most active state that could produce fuel for three or four months in short order.\n\nBut for all these aggressive moves, the core was, both Jekyll and Hyde, the two sides’ main antagonists. And now, despite their best efforts, the airstrikes, they approach this crisis with the United States’ limited mandate and a massive target in the air to strike at the heart of the Iranian regime. And, unfortunately, the war is far from over.\n\nThe question now is whether the former accuser — another Iranian, Ayatollah Khamenei, still holds the same, if anyone still exists, power and influence as before. And, unfortunately, the war is far from over.\n\nThe question now is whether the former accused — another Iranian, Ayatollah Khamenei, still holds the same, if anyone is still exists, power and influence as before.
