No. 60,184\n\n© 2024 The New York Times Company THURSDAY, JUNE 13, 2024\n\n# Israel Inquiry Of War Critic Raises Unease\n\nA Professor Is Detained After Speaking Out\n\nBY DAMIEN CAVE AND SHERRI SHERMAN\n\nJERUSALEM — Nadera Shalit, a professor at a Palestinian university, faced a prominent Israeli university, first asked to be the judge over the Gaza war by joining academics worldwide in signing a letter that called for a cease-fire. It included Israeli academics on the territory of a “genocide,” and the leaders of her university responded by urging her to resign.\n\nThat was soon after she was given an O.C. 1. Months later, the professor drew even more scrutiny by saying it was time “to admit Nazim” and accused Israel of political rape. She was briefly suspended in March by Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she has taught law and received work for nearly three decades. But right-wing Israeli politicians demanded more severe punishment, and in April, the professor was arrested.\n\n“I have been perceived as radical, a frontrunner, a leading candidate for a leadership flattered, and my name and my own behavior are maligned,” Professor Shalit told the Israeli OC Daily, the New York Times.\n\nThe professor is now under investigation for inaction in a territory — a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. And though she has not been charged, her case has prompted a protest outside Israel that read the message of the protesters: “Stop the genocide. End the war. End the war. End the war. End the war. End the war. End the end of the country. We are not going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going.”\n\nThe professor’s lawyers say in a brief hearing that her political views, and some of her testimony, were “inconsistent with the country’s university mission.” She was also indicted by the state of Israel, a “rebel and criminal,” and was sentenced to life in prison.\n\n“I am not going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be gone,” she said. “I am not going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going.”\n\nThe professor is also facing a criminal investigation.
