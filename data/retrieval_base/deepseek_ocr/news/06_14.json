Kavanaugh, the court held that the abortion group placed a direct stake in the dispute, a requirement to challenge the FDA’s approval of the pill, ultimately ruling.\n\n“The plaintiffs do not prescribe or use infrequently,” Justice Kavanaugh wrote. “And FDA is not requiring them to do so of certain forms only.”\n\nIn addition, “A plaintiff’s desire to make a drug less available or to rely on extra established funding is not required.”\n\nThe case originally sought to enjoin the FDA’s approval of the pill, but the Supreme Court in the decision ruled the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court
