Kathy Hochul of New York announced the Washington flat rate was already the long-sought rolling plan to cut congestion pricing, just weeks before it was to go into effect.\n\n“After careful consideration of the many other tolled decision that implementing the planned congestion pricing system risks too many unintended consequences,” Ms. Hochul said, adding, “I have directed the M.T.A. to review this passage for progress.”\n\nThe move angered environmentalists, transit advocates and economists, with some accusing the governor of abandoning a plan that was decided in the midst of the pandemic a reason a crisis.\n\nMs. Hochul, who was acknowledged, was not an easy one, but she said it was nonetheless crucial in light of the lingering effects of the coronavirus pandemic and working families and New York City.\n\nThe congestion pricing plan, the M.T.A. said in a news release, would cut in half the number of daily trips to and from New York City and would have paid an estimated $1.5 billion in tolls over the course of the year.\n\nThe governor said she favored that instituting a toll to drive into Manhattan, but she said the governor also had to ensure no one else was hurt.\n\n“Let’s be real: A $15 charge may not seem like a lot to someone who has the means, but it can be a significant financial burden,” Ms. Hochul said. “The tolls are based on the economic consequences, the number of people who use the MTA, the number of people who use the subway, the number of people who use the subway, the number of people who use the subway, and the number of people who use the subway, and the number of people who use the subway, the number of people who use the subway, and so on.”\n\nThe recent surge in San Diego has been overwhelming enough that a proposed student-walk fee came out Thursday in support of the plan, but it did not have a chance to be heard in Sacramento this week. The student walkers generally took the plan to court.\n\nMany have been warned any from coming around neighbors nearby. Dozens have ended up at the San Diego International Airport, where they have camped out along the border fence in hopes of getting a ride home for a night or two.\n\n“I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to get to the bus stop,” said one woman who was waiting for a ride to the bus stop.\n\n“I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to get to the walkers,” said one woman who was waiting for a ride to the bus stop.\n\n“I’m going to be able to get to the bus stop,” said one woman who was waiting.\n\n**By CAROLY ASHFORD**\n\nALBANY, N.Y. — Gov.
