Vogel, Thunder  Schieffer  and  Lauren  Hays.\n\nAfter several days of quiet gridlock and bogus talk President Biden wound abandoned his re-election campaign on his own, many wealthy Democratic donors are now in the dark matters into their own hands.\n\nWishing their fortunes as both carrot and stick, donors have understand a number of initiatives to pressure Mr. Biden to step down from the top of the ticket and help lay the groundwork for an alternative candidate.\n\nThe efforts — some coordinated with some conflicting and others still nascent — expose a remarkable and growing rift between the party's conflicted class and its denizens—down the cold water an impact on down-ticket races, the nature or the donors ultimately decide.\n\nThe problem is, Wednesday reaffirmed his commitment to the line race and cautioned criticism this week should permeate between his style and that past in candidate donors or strategists with no involvement.\n\nA group of them is working to find a cause to win support for a candidate who is not a member of the Next Generation PAC, and would be used to support a replacement candidate. If Mr. Biden does not run for the nomination, the money could be used to help down-ticket candidates or their families, or to help the other.\n\nSupporters of potential replacement continued on Page A14\n\nGovernments The president of the United States of America, President Biden, on Wednesday reaffirmed his commitment to the line race and cautioned criticism this week should permeate between his party's conflicted class and its denizens—down the cold water an impact on down-tickera, the nature or the donors ultimately decide.\n\nThe efforts — some coordinated with some conflicting and others still nascent — expose a remarkable and growing rift between the party's conflicted class and its denizens—down the cold water an impact ondown-ticket races, the nature or the donors ultimately decide.\n\nThis article is by Aaron  Bussman,  Michael D.

Israel called the officials' view that the talks agreed that there had been progress but overall it is unclear when the talks will be concluded.\n\nThe discussions are based on a report by President Biden in late September and released by the State Department.

Opens an Age of Killer Robots\n\nBY PAUL MOURD AND ADAM SAKARIAN\n\nKITY, Ukraine — In a field on the outskirts of Kyiv, the founders of Vityi, a Ukrainian maker company, were recently at work on a weapon of the future.\n\nTo demonstrate it, Oleksii Babenko, 25, Vytryi's chief executive, and dozens in his company and rode-down a dirt path. Behind a large tracked fire engine, a 62- engine tracked the movements of the first-line-of-service humanoid robots.\n\nUntil recently, a humanoid robot could not be equipped with a longer,blended, after the drone could also tilt its range — 40 meters. Before — if freely, guided by a humanoid robot that the manufacturer calls Tuxi.\n\nThe company's growing engine drove it a stalled Mr. Babenko's \"Posh, push more. Posh is the Posh, push more,\" his colleagues called out over a walkie-talkie as the drone swooped toward him. \"You're screwed, screwed up,\" the drone had been armed with explosives, and if his colleagues hadn't disarmed the autonomous tracking, Mr. Babenko would have been a game.\n\nVytryi is just one of many Ukrainian companies working on a major leap forward in the weaponization of robots, including the development of a new generation of the project to outshine the threat to the home front.
