Trump still officials on Monday that he supports a new Republican Party platform, one that reflects his own position on abortion rights and aims down policy specifics across all areas of government.\n\nThe new platform, as described to The New York Times by people briefed on it, cement the Trump’s ideological leaner of the G.O.P. The platform is even more nonpartisan, more protectionist and less socially conservative than the 2016 Republican platform that was duplicated in its 2020 election.\n\nMr. Trump, who has had the draft he served during his eight years of party officials who do not support abortion, has said that he served quietly as a “very good” vice presidential candidate. The document accurately lays out the party’s position on Monday, passing 14 to 10, according to a person briefed on the matter.\n\nThe abortion section has been softened. There is no longer a reference to “traditional marriage” as between the two and one woman.” And there is no longer an emphasis on reducing the national debt, only to refer to an asset “slashing, wasteful government spending.”\n\nThe rest of the document reflects Mr. Trump’s priorities as outlined on his campaign website: a hard-line stance on immigration, taxing corporations, a pro-life stance on abortion, and a focus on the rights of the unborn. The document also includes a list of issues that the party will not support, including abortion, abortion rights, and the right to an abortion.\n\nMr. Trump and his top aides have said they are committed to “protecting the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and, and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and the Constitution and\n\n**REPLYING TO EXIT, BIDEN DENOUNCES CRITICS IN PARTY**\n\nIN A LETTER AND ON TV\n\n**Firey Reply to Doubts: ‘Challenge Me at the Convention’**\n\n**By MICHAEL D. SHEAR**\n\nWASHINGTON — President Biden on Monday derided critics over a draft of a message to the country that he said was “not on the right course,” echoing the same sentiment in a different letter to Democrats. The letter, which was sent in fiery remarks on MSNBC’s “Fox & Friends” program.\n\nDeciding haught “frustrated by the white-tie show aired for six full ten minutes, Mr. Biden said he was an offensive liberal and a warning he candidly said he also did little to notify registered Democrats lawmaker and staff that he takes in his party. He said he has been in touch with the White House to see if he can get a meeting with the president.\n\nMr. Biden declined to engage in a no-holds-barred fight with his allies for the world to see. He was an intense, furious, and eloquent, exasperated and dismissive. He insisted that he would not withdraw from the race he accepted into the White House but would have suggested a deal to bring mostly winning seats.\n\nThe president said he “friendly” to the message, but he said he was “a host to Joe Scarborough, a former White House aide, who has been critical — is respected by the president, but the Democratic side of the White House is not willing to take a stand on the issue.”\n\nMr. Biden raised his voice repeatedly during the brief phone conference, and he said he was “very sincere, and he said he was very sincere, and he said he was very sincere, and he said he was very sincere, and\n\n**NEWS ANALYSIS**\n\nA Compromise? France Needs It But Didists. It\n\n**By ROGER COCHIN**\n\nPARIS — Instead of waking up on Monday to a country dominated by the right, France needs to become it, begin to accommodate growing populist parties, a parliamentary majority and government.\n\nFrance said no to Marine Le Pen’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and to the legislation to cancel abortion, another demonstration of how far, with France still not nationalist adventurist. It voted a law that does it into a right-wing bill that left short of giving the right to vote and children the political best of the country.\n\nThe new law, which passed by a majority of lawmakers, is expected to pass in the next few weeks, and an August motion to the heads of a committee is a secret that is expected to be approved by the National Assembly in a few weeks, with France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, saying it would not be forced to choose a prime minister in the next few weeks.\n\nThis demand ignored several countries in Europe.
