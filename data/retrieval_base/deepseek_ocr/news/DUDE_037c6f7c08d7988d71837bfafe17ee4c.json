    "text": "TO YOUR HEALTH\n\nUSDA Employees located in the Merchandise Mart Building: Are you familiar with the services available in the Health Unit? The Health Unit was formerly referred to as the \"First-Aid\" or \"Emergency Room.\" Now we prefer to think of it as the \"Health Unit\" and more emphasis is placed on Health Care. Of course, first-aid treatment of even minor wounds is still important and accidents should be reported promptly.\n\nThe actual treatment of illnesses is limited since we do not have a physician directly in charge. However, authorization is given for the administration of simple medication for the alleviation of some minor symptoms and disorders. You are advised to come to the Health Unit when symptoms of a cold or sore throat begin. Early treatment might prevent serious developments.\n\nSimple medications are available for mild stomach upsets or indigestion, but remember: Such symptoms can, also, indicate more serious involvements. If you have fever or other symptoms of importance, you may be advised to consult your physician.\n\nHyperdermic injections of medications, such as vitamins, may be given upon written authorization from your physician. A special form may be obtained from the Health Unit for this purpose.\n\nIf your doctor advises temporary rest during the day following major surgery or an extended illness, you may, with the approval of your supervisor, rest in the Health Unit for a period not in excess of one hour.\n\nWe suggest that you report to the Health Unit if you have had a serious illness or have some existing ailment. It would be helpful to have a record of your condition and the name of your physician in case you should become ill at work and need immediate assistance.\n\nTo ALL USDA EMPLOYEES: The USDA Club is still offering Polio Vaccine injections through the Health Unit. If you still have not received the series of three injections, you are urged to contact the nurse, EXT. 812.\n\n* * *\n\nSAFETY NOTES\n\n\"Accidents Will Happen\" is a familiar statement and an accident did happen in editing the USDA Club News last issue. The SAFETY NOTE was not completed so we shall repeat: Be a good office \"housekeeper\" and prevent accidents. Serious falls can result from such articles as rubber bands, paper clips, or even a slip of paper lying on the floor. Also, coffee or other liquids spilled should be wiped up immediately. Watch these minor things and prevent major accidents.\n\n* * *\n\nA man unable to choose between two evils, often hunts up a third.\n\nPRECY'S CORNER\n\nAt the January Meeting, USDA Club Officers it was decided that the latter part of March there should be a general meeting of USDA Members. Time and place of this stated meeting, as of the date of the paper, has not been established nor has a guest speaker been obtained. The committees are at work or the project and all members will be notified in ample time so that we may expect 100% attendance in the Dallas Area.\n\nIt is with much regret that the Compliance and Investigation Division of CSS reports the retirement of two of its members of the investigative staff. James P. McKenney and William H. Massenburg retired as of January 10, 1959, because of ill health. Both had been advised by their physician that the extensive travel necessitated by their work should not be continued. Mr. McKenney had been with this office for the past 19 years, and Mr. Massenburg since December 1954. Both had rendered valuable service and will be greatly missed.\n\n* * *\n\nAfter watching the squabbles that often develop in the splitting of estates, we can sympathize with the old fellow whose will contained just the following: \"Being of sound mind, I spent every cent I had.\""

Honey stocks were replenished generously by last year's good crop.\n\n**WORK ASSIGNMENTS MAY DIFFER FROM JOB DESCRIPTIONS**\n\nCommerce Department's house organ, the \"Log\" answers a question frequently asked by Federal employees:\n\n\"I Can I refuse to accept assignments of work because they are not described in my official position description?\"\n\n\"The answer is: Definitely not.\" An employee's position consists of the duties assigned to him by his superiors. The position description is not a prescription of duties. It is a report. If a position description becomes out of date, it should be replaced by a new and current description.\n\n\"Details to another position for a maximum period of 6 months may also be quite proper. Care should be taken, however, that temporary assignments do not become permanent without being shown in the official position description.\"\n\n**TOO TOP EMPLOYEES LEAVE CSS**\n\nResignation and retirement have taken two top flight men from their jobs in CSS.\n\nC. W. Polson, Chief, Commodity Operations Division, resigned Jan. 26, and A. E. Morris, Chief, Traffic Management Division, retired Jan. 31.\n\nPresent Acting Chiefs are Arnold E. Ferguson and Grant E. Ramsey, respectively.\n\nPolson, or \"Chet\", now is with Continental Grain Co., Kansas City, Mo., and \"The Colonel\" may be found at his home at 5934 Vanderbilt.\n\n\"Chet\" had been with USDA the past 20 years having been employed in county, state AAA and PMA offices in Pawnee County and Manhattan, Kan., and Washington, D. C., and in Dallas with CSS since 1952.\n\nA strong advocate of selling grains in world commerce, \"Chet\" has helped put across to the trade and others the advantages of merchandising the best quality of these grains, particularly high-protein wheat, because they bring more money. He will work primarily in the futures market in his new job and perhaps his friends soon will see him in action in the \"pit\" in Kansas City.\n\n\"The Colonel\", (U. S. Army ret.) dean of all traffic people in USDA, is a nationally-recognized traffic expert, whether the mode be rail, truck, jet or liner. Long years of traffic service in USDA, the Army and private industry, plus a law degree in which he specialized in transportation, have helped gain \"The Colonel\" this national recognition. He retired after 18-1/2 years of federal service, 13 years with USDA and 5-1/2 with the military.\n\nThese gentlemen have two things in common: Both are avid numismatists and philatelists."
