    "text": "two linear forms that generate the ideal of the line, together with any form of degree 7 vanishing on the points but not on the line. But Theorem 4.2(c) tells us that since the 7 points of \\( X \\) are in linearly general position the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of \\( S_X \\) (defined in Chapter 4) is 2, or equivalently, that the Betti diagram of \\( S_X \\) fits into 3 rows. Moreover, the ring \\( S_X \\) is reduced and of dimension 1 so it has depth 1. The Auslander-Buchsbaum Formula A2.15 shows that the resolution will have length 3. Putting this together, and using Corollary 1.9 we see that the minimal free resolution of \\( S_X \\) must have Betti diagram of the form\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 1 & - & - & - \\\\\n1 & - & \\beta_{1,2} & \\beta_{2,3} & \\beta_{3,4} \\\\\n2 & - & \\beta_{1,3} & \\beta_{2,4} & \\beta_{3,5} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nwhere the \\( \\beta_{i,j} \\) that are not shown are zero. In particular, the ideal of \\( X \\) is generated by quadrics and cubics.\n\nUsing Corollary 1.10 we compute successively \\( \\beta_{1,2} = 3 \\), \\( \\beta_{1,3} - \\beta_{2,3} = 1 \\), \\( \\beta_{2,4} - \\beta_{3,4} = 6 \\), \\( \\beta_{3,5} = 3 \\), and the Betti diagram has the form\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 1 & - \\\\\n1 & - & 3 & \\beta_{2,3} & \\beta_{3,4} \\\\\n2 & 1 + \\beta_{2,3} & 6 + \\beta_{3,4} & 3 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\n(This is the same diagram as at the end of the previous section. Here is the connection: Extending the ground field if necessary to make it infinite, we could use Lemma A2.3 and choose a linear form \\( x \\in S \\) that is a nonzerodivisor on \\( S_X \\). By Lemma 3.15 the graded Betti numbers of \\( S_X / xS_X \\) as an \\( S / xS \\)-module are the same as those of \\( S_X \\) as an \\( S \\)-module. Using our knowledge of the Hilbert function of \\( S_X \\) and the exactness of the sequence\n\n\\[0 \\longrightarrow S_X(-1) \\xrightarrow{x} S_X \\longrightarrow S_X / xS_X \\longrightarrow 0,\\]\n\nwe see that the cyclic \\( (S / xS) \\)-module \\( S_X / xS_X \\) has Hilbert function with values 1, 3, 3. This is what we used in Section 2B.)\n\n... and Other Information in the Resolution\n\nWe see that even in this simple case the Hilbert function does not determine the \\( \\beta_{i,j} \\), and indeed they can take different values. It turns out that the difference reflects a fundamental geometric distinction between different sets \\( X \\) of 7 points in linearly general position in \\( \\mathbb{P}^3 \\): whether or not \\( X \\) lies on a curve of degree 3.\n\nUp to linear automorphisms of \\( \\mathbb{P}^3 \\) there is only one irreducible curve of degree 3 not contained in a plane. This twisted cubic is one of the rational normal curves studied in Chapter 6. Any 6 points in linearly general position in \\( \\mathbb{P}^3 \\) lie"
