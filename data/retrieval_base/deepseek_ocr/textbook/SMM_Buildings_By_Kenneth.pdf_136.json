It is a maximal ideal, since every element of \\(A\\) not in \\(\\pi A\\) is a unit. The quotient ring \\(k = A/\\pi A\\) is therefore a field, called the residue field associated to the valuation \\(v\\).\n\nExample. Let \\(K\\) be the field \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) of rational numbers, and let \\(p\\) be a prime number. The \\(p\\)-adic valuation on \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is defined by setting \\(v(x)\\) equal to the exponent of \\(p\\) in the prime factorization of \\(x\\). More precisely, given \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q}^*\\), write \\(x = p^n u\\), where \\(n\\) is a (possibly negative) integer and \\(u\\) is a rational number whose numerator and denominator are not divisible by \\(p\\); then \\(v(x) = n\\). The valuation ring \\(A\\) is the ring of fractions \\(a/b\\) with \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(b\\) not divisible by \\(p\\). [The ring \\(A\\) happens to be the localization of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) at \\(p\\), but we will not make any use of this.] The residue field \\(k\\) is the field \\(\\mathbb{F}_p\\) of integers mod \\(p\\); one sees this by using the homomorphism \\(A \\to \\mathbb{F}_p\\) given by \\(a/b \\mapsto (a \\mod p)(b \\mod p)^{-1}\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are as above.\n\nThe valuation ring \\(A\\) in this example can be described informally as the largest subring of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) on which reduction mod \\(p\\) makes sense. It is thus the natural ring to introduce if one wants to relate the field \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) to the field \\(\\mathbb{F}_p\\). This illustrates our point of view toward valuations: We will be interested in studying things (namely, matrix groups) defined over a field \\(K\\), and we wish to \"reduce\" to a simpler field \\(k\\) as an aid in this study; a discrete valuation makes this possible by providing us with a nice ring \\(A\\) to serve as intermediary between \\(K\\) and \\(k\\):\n\n\\[A \\leftrightarrow K\\]\n\n\\[\\downarrow\\]\n\n\\[k\\]\n\nReturning now to the general theory, we note that the study of the arithmetic of \\(A\\) (e.g., ideals and prime factorization) is fairly trivial:\n\n**Proposition 1.** A discrete valuation ring \\(A\\) is a principal ideal domain, and every non-zero ideal is generated by \\(\\pi^n\\) for some \\(n \\geq 0\\). In particular, \\(\\pi A\\) is the unique non-zero prime ideal of \\(A\\).\n\n**Proof:** Let \\(I\\) be a non-zero ideal and let \\(n = \\min\\{v(a) : a \\in I\\}\\). Then \\(I\\) contains \\(\\pi^n\\), and every element of \\(I\\) is divisible by \\(\\pi^n\\); hence \\(I = \\pi^n A\\). \\(\\square\\)\n\nOne consequence of this is that we can apply the basic facts about modules over a principal ideal domain (e.g., a submodule of a free module is free). Let's recall some of these facts, in the form in which we'll need them later. Let \\(V\\) be the vector space \\(K^n\\). By a lattice (or \\(A\\)-lattice) in \\(V\\) we will mean an \\(A\\)-submodule \\(L \\subset V\\) of the form \\(L = Ae_1 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus Ae_n\\) for some basis \\(e_1, \\ldots, e_n\\) of \\(V\\). In particular, \\(L\\) is a free \\(A\\)-module of rank \\(n\\). If we take \\(e_1, \\ldots, e_n\\) to be the standard basis of \\(V\\), then the resulting lattice is \\(A^n\\), which we call the standard lattice."
