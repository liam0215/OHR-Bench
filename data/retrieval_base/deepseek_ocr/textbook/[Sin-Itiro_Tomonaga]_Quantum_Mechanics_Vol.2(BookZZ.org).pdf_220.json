(59.12), by the way, is given by\n\n\\[\nP(q) = \\frac{1}{\\pi \\hbar \\delta} \\exp \\left\\{ -\\frac{1}{\\delta^2} (q - q^0)^2 \\right\\}.\n\\]  \n(59.19)\n\n(iv) THE UNCERTAINTY RELATION\n\nThe two uncertainties (\\( \\Delta q \\) and \\( \\Delta p \\)) obtained in the last subsection seem to show a reciprocal relation. Namely, according to Eqs. (59.14) and (59.17), respectively,\n\n\\[\n\\Delta q = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\delta\n\\]  \n(59.20)\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p = \\left( \\frac{h}{2\\pi} \\right) \\frac{1}{\\delta \\sqrt{2}}.\n\\]\n\nThat is, \\( \\Delta q \\) is proportional to \\( \\delta \\) while \\( \\Delta p \\) is to \\( 1/\\delta \\). Therefore, an effort to reduce \\( \\Delta q \\) inevitably causes an increase in \\( \\Delta p \\) and vice versa.\n\nFrom Eq. (59.20) we find that\n\n\\[\n\\Delta p \\cdot \\Delta q = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{h}{2\\pi}.\n\\]  \n(59.21)\n\nIt says, for instance, that \\( \\Delta p \\) approaches infinity if \\( \\Delta q \\) tends to 0 and \\( \\Delta q \\) approaches infinity if \\( \\Delta p \\) tends to 0. In other words, in a state in which the coordinate has a definite value, the value of momentum is completely indefinite and in a state in which the momentum has a definite value, the value of coordinate is completely indefinite.\n\nThe relation (59.21) has been derived from the consideration of a specific wave packet of the form of Eq. (59.12). The question is then, what happens if we take a state other than that chosen here. We give the answer first. For a general \\( \\psi \\), the relation given in Eq. (59.21) does not necessarily hold, but the product \\( \\Delta p \\Delta q \\) never becomes smaller than the value given by Eq. (59.21). We have namely"
