We can add this 1 to our example, though, without any difficulty. If there are 0 stairs, then there’s only 1 way to climb this staircase: do nothing! So \\( f(0) = 1 \\) makes sense. Also note that \\( f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2 \\), so that our equation \\( f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) \\) holds for all positive integers \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n\nWhen we add this first 1 to our sequence, we get the sequence that we first saw at the start of the chapter:\n\n\\[\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,\n34, 55, 89, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThese numbers are called the Fibonacci numbers, in honor of the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, whose nickname was “Fibonacci,” and who first published the sequence of numbers in his _Liber abaci_ in 1202.\n\nWe’ve seen that each Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers. We can write this using a more formal definition.\n\nWe typically denote sequences using a variable with a subscript, such as\n\n\\[\na_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( a_1 \\) is the first number in the sequence, \\( a_2 \\) is the second number in the sequence, and so on. Sometimes we’ll start our lists with \\( a_0 \\) instead of \\( a_1 \\), so that our sequence would be\n\n\\[\na_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThe Fibonacci numbers are defined by \\( F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, \\) and \\( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\) for all positive integers \\( n > 2 \\). So, for example,"
