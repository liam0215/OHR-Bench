Let \\(O\\) denote the subgroup of \\(E_2\\) which consists of the orthogonal transformations. In other words the elements of \\(O\\) are rotations about the origin and reflections in lines through the origin. The discussion in the previous paragraph shows that \\(E_2 = TO\\).\n\nThe intersection of \\(T\\) and \\(O\\) is just the identity transformation because every non-trivial translation moves the origin, whereas every element of \\(O\\) keeps the origin fixed. The usual argument now shows that each isometry can be written in only one way as an orthogonal transformation followed by a translation. For if \\(g = \\tau f = \\tau' f'\\) where \\(\\tau, \\tau' \\in T\\) and \\(f, f' \\in O\\), then \\((\\tau')^{-1} \\tau = f'f^{-1}\\) lies in \\(T \\cap O\\) and hence \\(\\tau = \\tau', f = f'\\). If \\(g = \\tau f\\) and if \\(f\\) is a rotation, then \\(g\\) is called a direct isometry. In the other case, when \\(f\\) is a reflection, \\(g\\) is said to be an opposite isometry.\n\nSuppose \\(f \\in O\\), \\(\\tau \\in T\\) and \\(\\tau(0) = v\\). Then for each \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\) we have\n\n\\[f \\tau f^{-1} (x) = f(v + f^{-1} (x)) = f(v) + f(f^{-1} (x)) \\quad \\text{because } f \\text{ is linear} = f(v) + x.\\]\n\nTherefore the conjugate \\(f \\tau f^{-1}\\) is translation by the vector \\(f(v)\\). Since the elements of \\(T\\) and \\(O\\) together generate \\(E_2\\), we see (using (15.2)) that \\(T\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(E_2\\).\n\nWe can now understand the product structure of our group in terms of the decomposition \\(E_2 = TO\\). If \\(g = \\tau f, h = \\tau_1 f_1\\) where \\(\\tau, \\tau_1 \\in T\\) and \\(f, f_1 \\in O\\), then\n\n\\[gh = \\tau f \\tau_1 f_1 = (\\tau f \\tau_1 f^{-1}) (f f_1)\\]\n\nexpresses \\(gh\\) as an orthogonal transformation followed by a translation. Put another way the correspondence\n\n\\[g \\rightarrow (\\tau, f)\\]\n\nis an isomorphism between \\(E_2\\) and the semidirect product \\(T \\times_{\\varphi} O\\) where \\(\\varphi: O \\rightarrow \\text{Aut}(T)\\) is given by conjugation.\n\nSpecific calculations are best carried out using rather different notation. Suppose \\(g = \\tau f\\) where \\(\\tau \\in T\\) and \\(f \\in O\\). If \\(v = \\tau(0)\\), and if \\(M\\) is the orthogonal matrix which represents \\(f\\) in the standard basis for \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\), then\n\n\\[g(x) = v + f_M(x) = v + xM^t \\quad (*)\\]\n\nfor all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\). Conversely, given \\(v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\) and \\(M \\in O_2\\), the formula \\((*)\\) determines an isometry of the plane. We may therefore think of each isometry as an ordered pair \\((v, M)\\) in which \\(v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\) and \\(M \\in O_2\\), with multiplication given by\n\n\\[(v, M)(v_1, M_1) = (v + f_M(v_1), M M_1).\\]\n\nIf we are pressed to be very precise we explain that we have identified \\(E_2\\) with the semidirect product \\(\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times_{\\psi} O_2\\), the homomorphism \\(\\psi: O_2 \\rightarrow \\text{Aut}(\\mathbb{R}^2)\\) being the usual action of \\(O_2\\) on \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). Notice that \\((v, M)\\) is a direct isometry when \\(\\det M = +1\\) and an opposite isometry when \\(\\det M = -1\\).\n\nThe \"simplest\" isometries are easily described as ordered pairs. Let\n\n\\[A = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta \\\\ \\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad B = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos \\varphi & \\sin \\varphi \\\\ \\sin \\varphi & -\\cos \\varphi \\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nand let \\(l, m\\) be the lines shown in Figure 24.3.\n\n    m    l\n    |    |\n    |    |\n    |    |\n    |    |\n    |_____|\n    |    |\n    |    |\n    |    |\n    |    |\n    |______|\n\nFigure 24.3\n\n\n\n\ndecomposition \\( E_2 = TO \\).
