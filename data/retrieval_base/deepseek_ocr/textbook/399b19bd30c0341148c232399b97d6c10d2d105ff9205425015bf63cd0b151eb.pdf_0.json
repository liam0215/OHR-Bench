Greer\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nTo survive, trees must complete multiple tasks, which can be optimized for. The closer a tree is to being optimised for a task, the better it does that task, but the more risk it takes on. A species’ optimization is determined by how well it fits a corresponding model.\n\n- Hydraulic efficiency is predicted by Murray’s Law, which is based off area being conserved at branching points.\n- Structural support of limbs is predicted by the Uniform Stress Model (USM). Over optimization (ratio >1) puts branches at risk of breaking, so a safety margin must be kept.\n- Total size is optimized under the West-Brown-Enquist (WBE) Model, if over optimized trees are more susceptible to wind. These models have previously been used with destructive methods, we aim to develop a photographic based methodology, that can still produce precise and accurate enough data to distinguish between models and species.\n\n**METHODS**\n\n- DBH and scaled photos of the entire tree and first node were taken for 30 *Ginkgo*.\n- Tree height, mother diameter, daughter diameter, and angle between branches of the basal node were measured using ImageJ (NIH).\n- For each model a regression compared observed data for mother and daughter attributes, and predicted values were generated using residuals from the observed data regression. An ANCOVA compared slope and y-intercept of the observed regression and the predicted.\n\n**KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS**\n\n- Photographic data allowed us to see where *Ginkgo* deviated from the models’ predictions, the biggest deviation being from the WBE model. (Fig. 4)\n- *Ginkgo* best fit Murray’s Law and USM, respectively. (Fig. 5) Thus *Ginkgo* is best optimized for hydraulic efficiency and structural support, at the cost of total mass.\n- We do not know why *Ginkgo* keeps such a large safety margin for total mass. One hypothesis is that because *Ginkgo* was mostly found in cities, where it does not have nearby trees to compete with, reducing pressure to be tall. Lack of neighbors also means *Ginkgo* are more exposed to the wind.\n- The photographic data we gathered provided usable data that highlighted even small deviations from the models and differences between species.\n\n**BOTTOMLINE**\n\nAs a proof of concept that photographs can yield usable data, our experiments were a success. It is also clear that different species optimize for different tasks, and that for *Ginkgo biloba* minimizing the risk of buckling in the wind is important.\n\n**Figure 1.** Full tree image for a *Ginkgo*.\n\n**Figure 2.** Node 1 image for a *Ginkgo*.\n\n**Figure 3.** Node image with ImageJ measurements labeled.\n\n**Figure 4.** ANCOVA for WBE model, the slopes of observed and predicted differed statistically significantly. Observed *Ginkgo* differed from models’ predictions most in its optimization for total mass."
