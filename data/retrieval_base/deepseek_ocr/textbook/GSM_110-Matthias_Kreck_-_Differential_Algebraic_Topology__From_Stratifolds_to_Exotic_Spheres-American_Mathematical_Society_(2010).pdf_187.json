Thus we conclude:\n\n**Theorem 18.6.** Two Milnor manifolds \\(M_{k,-k}\\) and \\(M_{r,-r}\\) are diffeomorphic if and only if \\(|k| = |r|\\).\n\n5. Exercises\n\n(1) Let \\(E\\) be a complex vector bundle over \\(S^{4k}\\). Give a formula for the Pontrjagin class \\(p_k(E)\\) in terms of \\(c_{2k}(E)\\).\n\n(2) Let \\(E\\) be a \\(2k\\)-dimensional oriented vector bundle. Prove that \\(p_k(E) = e(E) \\sim e(E)\\).\n\n(3) Let \\(E\\) be a not necessarily oriented \\(2k\\)-dimensional vector bundle. Prove that the class represented by \\(p_k(E)\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\)-cohomology is equal to \\(w_{2k}(E) \\sim w_{2k}(E)\\).\n\n(4) Prove that \\(\\langle p_k(E), [S^{4k}] \\rangle\\) is even for all vector bundles \\(E\\) over \\(S^{4k}\\). You can use (or better prove it as an application of Sard’s theorem) that an \\(r\\)-dimensional vector bundle over \\(S^n\\) with \\(r > n\\) is isomorphic to \\(F \\oplus (S^n \\times \\mathbb{R}^{r-n})\\) for some \\(n\\)-dimensional vector bundle \\(F\\)."
