Its restriction $\\pi|_G$ to $G$ is an algebraic, hence by the proven theorem also a topological isomorphism between $G$ and $E/F$. The projection $p_G: E \\to G$ has the form $p_G = (\\pi|_G)^{-1} \\circ \\pi$, hence is continuous. $\\square$\n\n1.5.4. Definition. A subset $A$ of a topological vector space $E$ is called precompact or totally bounded if, for every neighborhood of zero $V$ in $E$, one can find a finite set $\\{a_1, \\ldots, a_n\\}$ in $E$ such that $A \\subset \\bigcup_{k=1}^n (a_k + V)$.\n\nThe set $\\{a_1, \\ldots, a_n\\}$ is called a finite $V$-net (or an $\\varepsilon$-net if $V$ is a ball of radius $\\varepsilon$ in a metric space). It is easily seen that every compact set in a topological vector space is precompact. We observe (this fact is not needed now, so it will be proven in § 1.8 after we discuss completions of topological vector spaces) that a subset of a topological vector space is precompact precisely when its closure in the completion of this topological vector space is compact. However, the closure of a precompact set in an incomplete space may fail to be compact.\n\n1.5.5. Lemma. Every precompact subset of a topological vector space is bounded.\n\nProof. Let $A$ be a precompact subset of a topological vector space $E$ and let $V$ be a neighborhood of zero in $E$; we have to prove that there exists $\\nu > 0$ such that $A \\subset tV$ if $|t| > \\nu$. Let $W$ be a circled neighborhood of zero such that $W + W \\subset V$ and let $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ be elements of $E$ for which $A \\subset \\bigcup_{k=1}^n (a_k + W)$. Let $\\nu > 1$ be such that $\\{a_1, \\ldots, a_n\\} \\subset tW$ if $|t| > \\nu$. Then for such numbers $t$ we have\n\n$$A \\subset \\bigcup_{k=1}^n (a_k + W) \\subset tW + W \\subset tW + tW = t(W + W) \\subset tV,$$\n\nwhich shows that $A$ is bounded. $\\square$\n\n1.5.6. Theorem. A Hausdorff topological vector space $E$ over the field $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ is finite-dimensional if and only if it possess a compact neighborhood of zero. Moreover, it is sufficient that it possess a precompact neighborhood of zero.\n\nProof. The necessity is clear from Theorem 1.5.1, since any Hausdorff topological vector space (over a nondiscrete complete normed field $\\mathbb{K}$) of finite dimension $n$ is isomorphic (as a topological vector space) to the space $\\mathbb{K}^n$, and if $S$ is a compact neighborhood of zero in $\\mathbb{K}$, then the product of $n$ copies of $S$ is a compact neighborhood of zero in $\\mathbb{K}^n$.\n\nLet us prove the sufficiency (the given proof is due to Gleason). Let $V$ be a precompact neighborhood of zero in $E$ and let $a_1, \\ldots, a_n \\in E$ be elements such that\n\n$$V \\subset \\bigcup_{k=1}^n (a_k + \\frac{1}{2}V). \\tag{1.5.3}$$\n\nWe show that the linear span of the set $A = \\{a_1, \\ldots, a_n\\}$ coincides with the whole space, i.e., that every element in $E$ is a linear combination of elements of"
