    "text": "296 Chapter 5. Commutative Rings II\n\nProposition 5.1 (Correspondence Theorem for Rings). If \\( I \\) is a proper ideal in a commutative ring \\( R \\), then there is an inclusion-preserving bijection \\( \\varphi \\) from the set of all ideals \\( J \\) in \\( R \\) containing \\( I \\) to the set of all ideals in \\( R/I \\), given by\n\\[ \\varphi: J \\mapsto J/I = \\{a + I: a \\in J\\}. \\]\n\nProof. If we forget its multiplication, the commutative ring \\( R \\) is merely an additive abelian group and its ideal \\( I \\) is a (normal) subgroup. The Correspondence Theorem for Groups, Theorem 1.82, now applies to the natural map \\( \\pi: R \\to R/I \\), and it gives an inclusion-preserving bijection\n\\[ \\Phi: \\{ \\text{all subgroups of } R \\text{ containing } I \\} \\to \\{ \\text{all subgroups of } R/I \\}, \\]\nwhere \\( \\Phi(J) = \\pi(J) = J/I \\).\n\nIf \\( J \\) is an ideal, then \\( \\Phi(J) \\) is also an ideal, for if \\( r \\in R \\) and \\( a \\in J \\), then \\( ra \\in J \\), and\n\\[ (r + I)(a + I) = ra + I \\in J/I. \\]\nLet \\( \\varphi \\) be the restriction of \\( \\Phi \\) to the set of intermediate ideals; \\( \\varphi \\) is an injection because \\( \\Phi \\) is an injection. To see that \\( \\varphi \\) is surjective, let \\( J^* \\) be an ideal in \\( R/I \\). Now \\( \\pi^{-1}(J^*) \\) is an intermediate ideal in \\( R \\), for it contains \\( I = \\pi^{-1}((0)) \\), and\n\\[ \\varphi(\\pi^{-1}(J^*)) = \\pi(\\pi^{-1}(J^*)) = J^*. \\]\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{c}\nR \\\\\n| \\\\\nJ' \\quad R/I \\\\\n| \\quad | \\\\\nJ \\quad J'/I \\\\\n| \\quad | \\\\\nI \\quad J/I \\\\\n| \\quad | \\\\\n(0)\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nFigure 5.1. Correspondence Theorem.\n\nUsually, the Correspondence Theorem for Rings is invoked, tacitly, by saying that every ideal in the quotient ring \\( R/I \\) has the form \\( J/I \\) for some unique ideal \\( J \\) with \\( I \\subseteq J \\subseteq R \\).\n\nExample 5.2. Let \\( I = (m) \\) be a nonzero ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). If \\( J \\) is an ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) containing \\( I \\), then \\( J = (a) \\) for some \\( a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) (because \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is a PID). Since \\( (m) \\subseteq (a) \\) if and only if \\( a \\mid m \\), the Correspondence Theorem for Rings shows that every ideal in the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}/I = \\mathbb{I}_m \\) has the form \\( J/I = ([a]) \\) for some divisor \\( a \\) of \\( m \\).\n\nDefinition. An ideal \\( I \\) in a commutative ring \\( R \\) is called a prime ideal if it is a proper ideal, that is, \\( I \\neq R \\), and \\( ab \\in I \\) implies that \\( a \\in I \\) or \\( b \\in I \\).\n\nExample 5.3.\n\n(i) The ideal \\( (0) \\) is a prime ideal in a ring \\( R \\) if and only if \\( R \\) is a domain.\n\n1If \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are sets, \\( f: X \\to Y \\) is a function, and \\( S \\) is a subset of \\( Y \\), then \\( ff^{-1}(S) \\subseteq S \\); if \\( f \\) is surjective, then \\( ff^{-1}(S) = S \\)."
