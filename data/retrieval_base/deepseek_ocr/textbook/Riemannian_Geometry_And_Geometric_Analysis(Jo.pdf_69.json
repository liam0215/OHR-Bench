    "text": "necessarily nondegenerate quadratic form on $V$ would suffice, but here we have no need to investigate the most general possible construction. On the contrary, for our purposes it suffices to take $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with its standard Euclidean scalar product. An orthonormal basis will be denoted by $e_1, \\ldots, e_n$.\n\n**Definition 1.8.1** The Clifford algebra $\\mathrm{Cl}(V)$, also denoted $\\mathrm{Cl}(n)$, is the quotient of the tensor algebra $\\bigoplus_{k \\geq 0} V \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes V$ generated by $V$ by the two sided ideal generated by all elements of the form $v \\otimes v + \\|v\\|^2$ for $v \\in V$.\n\nThus, the multiplication rule for the Clifford algebra $\\mathrm{Cl}(V)$ is\n\n$$vw + wv = -2\\langle v, w \\rangle \\tag{1.8.1}$$\n\nIn particular, in terms of our orthonormal basis $e_1, \\ldots, e_n$, we have\n\n$$e_i^2 = -1 \\text{ and } e_ie_j = -e_ie_j \\text{ for } i \\neq j. \\tag{1.8.2}$$\n\nFrom this, one easily sees that a basis of $\\mathrm{Cl}(V)$ as a real vector space is given by\n\n$$e_0 := 1, \\quad e_\\alpha := e_{\\alpha_1}e_{\\alpha_2} \\ldots e_{\\alpha_k}$$\n\nwith $\\alpha = \\{\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_k\\} \\subset \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $\\alpha_1 < \\alpha_2 \\ldots < \\alpha_k$. For such an $\\alpha$, we shall put $|\\alpha| := k$ in the sequel. Thus, as a vector space, $\\mathrm{Cl}(V)$ is isomorphic to $\\Lambda^*(V)$ (as algebras, these two spaces are of course different). In particular, the dimension of $\\mathrm{Cl}(V)$ as a vector space is $2^n$. Also, declaring this basis as being orthonormal, we obtain a scalar product on $\\mathrm{Cl}(V)$ extending the one on $V$.\n\nWe define the degree of $e_\\alpha$ as being $|\\alpha|$. The $e_\\alpha$ of degree $k$ generate the subset $\\mathrm{Cl}^k(V)$ of elements of degree $k$. We have\n\n$$\\mathrm{Cl}^0 = \\mathbb{R}$$\n\n$$\\mathrm{Cl}^1 = V.$$\n\nFinally, we let $\\mathrm{Cl}^{ev}(V)$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{odd}(V)$ be the subspaces of elements of even, resp. odd degree. The former is a subalgebra of $\\mathrm{Cl}(V)$, but not the latter.\n\n**Lemma 1.8.1** The center of $\\mathrm{Cl}(V)$ consists of those elements that commute with all $v \\in \\mathrm{Cl}^1(V) = V$. For $n$ even, the center is $\\mathrm{Cl}^0(V)$, while for $n$ odd, it is $\\mathrm{Cl}^0(V) \\oplus \\mathrm{Cl}^n(V)$.\n\n**Proof.** It suffices to consider basis vectors $e_\\alpha = e_{\\alpha_1} \\ldots e_{\\alpha_k}$ as above. For $j \\notin \\alpha$, we have\n\n$$e_\\alpha e_j = (-1)^{|\\alpha|}e_j e_\\alpha,$$\n\nand thus $|\\alpha|$ has to be even for $e_\\alpha$ to commute with $e_j$, while\n\n$$e_\\alpha e_{\\alpha_j} = (-1)^{|\\alpha|-1}e_{\\alpha_j} e_\\alpha,$$"
