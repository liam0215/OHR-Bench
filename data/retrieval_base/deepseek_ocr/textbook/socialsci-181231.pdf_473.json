It has about 3,600 companies. |\n| FTSE: http://www.ftse.com | Includes the 100 largest companies on the London Stock Exchange. Pronounced “footsie.” Originally stood for Financial Times Stock Exchange. |\n| Nikkei: http://www.nikkei.co.jp/nikkeinfo/en/ | Nikkei stands for *Nihon Keizai Shimbun*, which translates as the Japan Economic Journal, a major business newspaper in Japan. Index includes the 225 largest and most actively traded stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. |\n| DAX: http://www.exchange.de | Tracks 30 of the largest companies on the Frankfurt, Germany, stock exchange. DAX is an abbreviation for *Deutscher Aktien Index* (German Stock Index). |\n\nTable 17.1 Some Stock Market Measures\n\nThe trend in the stock market is generally up over time, but with some large dips along the way. Figure 17.6 shows the path of the Standard & Poor’s 500 index (which is measured on the left-hand vertical axis) and the Dow Jones Index (which is measured on the right-hand vertical axis). Broad stock market measures, like the ones we list here, tend to move together. The S&P 500 Index is the weighted average market capitalization of the firms selected to be in the index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the price weighted average of 30 industrial stocks tracked on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nWhen the Dow Jones average rises from 5,000 to 10,000, you know that the average price of the stocks in that index has roughly doubled. Figure 17.6 shows that stock prices did not rise much in the 1970s, but then started a steady climb in the 1980s. From 2000 to 2013, stock prices bounced up and down, but ended up at about the same level.\n\nFigure 17.6 The Dow Jones Industrial Index and the Standard & Poor’s 500, 1965–2021 Stock prices rose dramatically from the 1980s up to about 2000. From 2000 to 2013, stock prices bounced up and down, but ended at about the same level. Since 2009, both indexes have for the most part increased.\n\nTable 17.2 shows the total annual rate of return an investor would have received from buying the stocks in the S&P 500 index over recent decades. The total return here includes both dividends paid by these companies and also capital gains arising from increases"
