Examples include such familiar substances as water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) and carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$). These compounds are very different from ionic compounds like sodium chloride ($\\text{NaCl}$). Ionic compounds are formed when metal atoms lose one or more of their electrons to nonmetal atoms. The resulting cations and anions are electrostatically attracted to each other.\n\nSo what holds the atoms of a molecule together? Rather than forming ions, the atoms of a molecule share their electrons in such a way that a bond forms between a pair of atoms. In a carbon dioxide molecule, there are two of these bonds, each occurring between the carbon atom and one of the two oxygen atoms.\n\nFigure 5.8.1: Carbon dioxide molecules consist of a central carbon atom bonded to 2 oxygen atoms.\n\nLarger molecules can have many, many bonds that serve to keep the molecule together. In a large sample of a given molecular compound, all of the individual molecules are identical.\n\nNaming Binary Molecular Compounds\n\nRecall that a molecular formula shows the number of atoms of each element that a molecule contains. A molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, so its formula is $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$. A molecule of octane, which is a component of gasoline, contains 8 atoms of carbon and 18 atoms of hydrogen. The molecular formula of octane is $\\text{C}_8\\text{H}_{18}$.\n\nFigure 5.8.2: Nitrogen dioxide ($\\text{NO}_2$) is a reddish-brown toxic gas that is a prominent air pollutant produced by internal combustion engines.\n\nNaming binary (two-element) molecular compounds is similar to naming simple ionic compounds. The first element in the formula is simply listed using the name of the element. The second element is named by taking the stem of the element name and adding the suffix -ide. A system of numerical prefixes is used to specify the number of atoms in a molecule. Table 5.8.1 lists these numerical prefixes.\n\nTable 5.8.1: Numerical Prefixes for Naming Binary Covalent Compounds\n\n| Number of Atoms in Compound | Prefix on the Name of the Element |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 1                           | mono-                           |\n| 2                           | di-                            |\n| 3                           | tri-                           |\n| 4                           | tetra-                         |\n| 5                           | penta-                         |\n| 6                           | hexa-                          |"
