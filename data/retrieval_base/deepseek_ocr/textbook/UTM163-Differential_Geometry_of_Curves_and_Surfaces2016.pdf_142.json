Every surface patch for a regular surface is a parametrized surface. A parametrized surface need not be one-to-one. For example, the function $\\sigma : \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ defined as $\\sigma(u, v) = (\\cos u, \\sin u, v)$ is a parametrized surface that wraps the plane infinitely many times around the cylinder; the restriction of this function to a smaller domain was used in Example 3.23 as a surface patch for the cylinder. Exercise 3.27 in this section (illustrated in Fig. 3.17) shows a parametrized surface that fails to be one-to-one because of more complicated kinds of self-intersections. In studying only local properties, it doesn’t matter whether one works with regular surfaces or parametrized surfaces, because of the following proposition:\n\nPROPOSITION 3.29.\nIf $\\sigma : U \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ is a parametrized surface, then for each $q_0 \\in U$, there exists an open set $\\tilde{U} \\subset U$ containing $q_0$ such that the image $S = \\sigma(\\tilde{U})$ is a regular surface covered by a single surface patch (namely, the restriction of $\\sigma$ to $\\tilde{U}$).\n\nProof. Let $q_0 \\in U$. Choose any $N \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ with $N \\notin \\text{span}\\{\\sigma_u(q_0), \\sigma_v(q_0)\\}$. Consider the smooth function $f : U \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ defined as follows:\n\n$$f(q, t) = \\sigma(q) + tN.$$\n\nSet $p_0 = \\sigma(q_0) = f(q_0, 0)$. The derivative $df_{(q_0, 0)} : \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ is invertible, because it sends the basis $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$ to the basis $\\{\\sigma_u(q_0), \\sigma_v(q_0), N\\}$. By the inverse function theorem (on page 120), $f$ restricts to a diffeomorphism from a neighborhood, $\\mathcal{A}$, of $(q_0, 0)$ in $U \\times \\mathbb{R} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R} = \\mathbb{R}^3$ to a neighborhood, $\\mathcal{B}$, of $p_0$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. We can assume (after possibly shrinking the neighborhoods) that $\\mathcal{A}$ has the form $\\mathcal{A} = \\tilde{U} \\times (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon > 0$ and $\\tilde{U} \\subset U$ is a neighborhood of $q_0$.\n\nDefine $S = \\sigma(\\tilde{U})$. Since $f$ is injective on $\\mathcal{A}$, it follows that $\\sigma$ is injective on $\\tilde{U}$, so it has an inverse $\\sigma^{-1} : S \\to \\tilde{U}$. It remains to prove that $\\sigma^{-1}$ is smooth. For this, let $P : \\mathcal{A} \\to U$ denote the natural projection that maps $(q, t) \\mapsto q$. The function $P \\circ f^{-1} : \\mathcal{B} \\to \\tilde{U}$ is a smooth function that agrees with $\\sigma^{-1}$ on $\\mathcal{B} \\cap S$, which verifies that $\\sigma^{-1}$ is smooth.\n\nIn light of Proposition 3.29, you might guess that the image of every injective parametrized surface is a regular surface, but counterexamples to this guess will be given in Sect. 10."
