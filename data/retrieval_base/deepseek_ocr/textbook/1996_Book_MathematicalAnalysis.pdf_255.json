We also observe that it suffices to consider Borel measurable functions, since every Lebesgue measurable function is almost everywhere equal to a Borel measurable function (Theorem 10.9). We carry out the proof with a short sequence of lemmas. Let us introduce some terminology and notation. A cube with center \\(\\xi\\) is a set of the form\n\\[Q = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : \\xi_j - h \\leq x_j < \\xi_j + h, 1 \\leq j \\leq n \\}.\\]\n(This describes a “half-open” cube, which will be convenient for our purposes. Closed and open cubes are defined similarly.) If \\( Q \\) is a cube with center \\(\\xi\\), and \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), let \\( Q^\\epsilon \\) denote the concentric cube with sides multiplied by \\( 1 + \\epsilon \\); thus, for the cube \\( Q \\) above,\n\\[Q^\\epsilon = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : \\xi_j - (1 + \\epsilon)h \\leq x_j < \\xi_j + (1 + \\epsilon)h, 1 \\leq j \\leq n \\}.\\]\nIt is clear that \\( m(Q^\\epsilon) = (1 + \\epsilon)^n m(Q) \\) for any cube \\( Q \\).\n\n10.47 Lemma. For each \\(\\xi \\in U\\), let \\( T_\\xi \\) be the affine map approximating \\(\\varphi\\) near \\(\\xi\\), i.e., \\( T_\\xi (x) = \\varphi(\\xi) + \\varphi'(\\xi)(x - \\xi) \\). For any compact subset \\( K \\) of \\( U \\), and any \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), there exists \\(\\delta = \\delta(K, \\epsilon) > 0\\) such that, for any cube \\( Q \\subset U \\) with center \\(\\xi\\) in \\( K \\) and diameter \\( < \\delta \\), we have\n\\[\\varphi(Q) \\subset T_\\xi (Q^\\epsilon). \\tag{10.4}\\]\nProof. Let \\( M = \\sup_{\\xi \\in K} \\| (\\varphi')^{-1}(\\xi) \\| \\); since \\( K \\) is compact and \\(\\varphi'\\) is continuous, we know \\( M < \\infty \\). The definition of the derivative of a mapping tells us that for any \\(\\eta > 0\\) there exists \\(\\delta = \\delta(\\xi, \\eta) > 0\\) such that \\( |\\varphi(x) - T_\\xi (x)| < \\eta |x - \\xi| \\) whenever \\( 0 < |x - \\xi| < \\delta \\). Since \\( K \\) is compact, and \\(\\varphi'\\) is continuous, we can choose \\(\\delta = \\delta(\\eta)\\) so that this holds for every \\(\\xi \\in K \\). It follows, since \\( T_\\xi^{-1} y - T_\\xi^{-1} z = [\\varphi'(\\xi)]^{-1} (y - z) \\), that\n\\[|T_\\xi^{-1} \\varphi(x) - x| = |T_\\xi^{-1} [\\varphi(x) - T_\\xi (x)]| \\leq M \\eta |x - \\xi|,\\]\nso that, if \\(\\eta > 0\\) is chosen sufficiently small (\\(\\eta < \\epsilon / (M \\sqrt{n})\\) will do), we have \\( T_\\xi^{-1} \\varphi(x) \\in Q^\\epsilon \\), or equivalently, \\(\\varphi(x) \\in T_\\xi (Q^\\epsilon) \\), whenever \\( x \\in Q \\) with \\( Q \\) a cube of diameter less than \\(\\delta\\) and center \\(\\xi \\in K \\).\n\n10.48 Lemma. If \\( B \\) is a Borel subset of \\( U \\), then\n\\[m(\\varphi(B)) \\leq \\int_B |J_\\varphi| dm. \\tag{10.5}\\]\nProof. Let \\( C \\) be a compact subset of \\(\\varphi(B) \\), and put \\( K = \\varphi^{-1}(C) \\), so \\( K \\) is a compact subset of \\( U \\). Let \\(\\epsilon > 0 \\). For each \\( i \\in \\mathbb{N} \\), let \\( K_i = \\{ x : \\varphi(x, K) \\leq 1/i \\} \\), where \\(\\rho(x, K) = \\inf \\{ |x - y| : y \\in K \\} \\). Then \\( K_i \\) is compact, and for sufficiently large \\( i \\), say \\( i \\geq i_0 \\), \\( K_i \\subset U \\). We note that \\( K_{i+1} \\subset K_i \\) for all \\( i \\), and \\(\\bigcap_i K_i = K \\). Since the function \\( A \\mapsto \\int_A |J_\\varphi| dm \\) is a measure, and"
