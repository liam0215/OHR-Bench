Since the opposite inclusion of (4) is obvious, it then follows that \\( C = \\text{conv}(\\text{ext } C) \\). But then we also have \\( C = \\text{conv } M \\) for any subset \\( M \\) of \\( C \\) containing ext \\( C \\).) We shall prove (4) by induction on the dimension of \\( C \\). For dim \\( C = -1 \\), 0 there is nothing to prove. For dim \\( C = 1 \\) the statement is clearly valid. Suppose that the statement is valid for all compact convex sets of dimension \\( <e \\), where \\( e \\geq 2 \\), and let \\( C \\) be a compact convex set of dimension \\( e \\). Let \\( x \\) be any point in \\( C \\); we shall prove that \\( x \\) is a convex combination of extreme points of \\( C \\), cf. Theorem 2.2. If \\( x \\) itself is an extreme point, there is nothing to prove. If \\( x \\) is not an extreme point, then there is a segment in \\( C \\) having \\( x \\) in its relative interior. Extending the segment, if necessary, we see that there are in fact points \\( y_0, y_1 \\in \\text{rb } C \\) such that \\( x \\in ]y_0, y_1[ \\). Let \\( F_0 \\) and \\( F_1 \\) be the smallest faces of \\( C \\) containing \\( y_0 \\) and \\( y_1 \\), respectively. Then \\( F_0 \\) and \\( F_1 \\) are proper faces of \\( C \\), cf. Corollary 5.7. They are, in particular, compact convex sets, cf. Theorem 5.1, and they both have dimension \\( <e \\), cf. Corollary 5.5. Then, by the induction hypothesis, there are points \\( x_{01}, \\ldots, x_{0p} \\in \\text{ext } F_0 \\) and \\( x_{11}, \\ldots, x_{1q} \\in \\text{ext } F_1 \\) such that \\( y_0 \\) is a convex combination of the \\( x_{0i} \\)'s and \\( y_1 \\) is a convex combination of the \\( x_{1j} \\)'s. Since \\( x \\) is a convex combination of \\( y_0 \\) and \\( y_1 \\), it follows that \\( x \\) is a convex combination of the \\( x_{0i} \\)'s and \\( x_{1j} \\)'s. To complete the proof, we note that the \\( x_{0i} \\)'s and \\( x_{1j} \\)' are in fact extreme points of \\( C \\); this follows from Theorem 5.2. □\n\nCorollary 5.11. Let \\( C \\) be a compact convex set in \\( \\mathbb{R}^d \\) with dim \\( C = n \\). Then each point of \\( C \\) is a convex combination of at most \\( n + 1 \\) extreme points of \\( C \\).\n\nProof. Combine Theorem 5.10(c) and Corollary 2.4. □\n\nExercises\n\n5.1. Show that ext \\( C \\) is closed when \\( C \\) is a 2-dimensional compact convex set.\n\n5.2. Let \\( C \\) be the convex hull of the set of points \\( (x_1, x_2, x_3) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\) such that\n\n\\[ x_1 = x_2 = 0, \\quad x_3 \\in [-1, 1], \\]\n\nor\n\n\\[ x_3 = 0, \\quad (x_1 - 1)^2 + x_2^2 = 1. \\]\n\nShow that ext \\( C \\) is non-closed.\n\n5.3. Let \\( C \\) be a closed convex set in \\( \\mathbb{R}^d \\). Show that if a convex subset \\( F \\) of \\( C \\) is a face of \\( C \\), then \\( C \\setminus F \\) is convex. Show that the converse does not hold in general.\n\n5.4. Let \\( C \\) be a non-empty closed convex set in \\( \\mathbb{R}^d \\). An affine subspace \\( A \\) of \\( \\mathbb{R}^d \\) is said to support \\( C \\) if \\( A \\cap C \\neq \\emptyset \\) and \\( C \\setminus A \\) is convex. Show that the supporting hyperplanes of \\( C \\) in the sense of Section 4 are the hyperplanes that support \\( C \\) in the sense just"
