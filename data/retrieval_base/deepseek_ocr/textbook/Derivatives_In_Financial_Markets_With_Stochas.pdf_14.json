The process \\( (\\xi_t^\\theta)_{0 \\leq t \\leq T} \\) is called the Radon-Nikodym process.\n\nThe main result of this section asserts that the process \\( (W_t^\\star) \\) given by (1.45) is a standard Brownian motion under the probability \\( IP^\\star \\). This result in its full generality (when \\( \\theta \\) is an adapted stochastic process) is known as Girsanov's theorem. In our simple case (\\( \\theta \\) constant), it is easily derived by using the characterization (1.3) and formula (1.49) as follows:\n\n\\[IE^\\star \\{ e^{iu(W_t^\\star - W_s^\\star)} | \\mathcal{F}_s \\} = \\frac{1}{\\xi_s^\\theta} IE \\{ \\xi_t^\\theta e^{iu(W_t^\\star - W_s^\\star)} | \\mathcal{F}_s\\} \\]\n\n\\[= e^{\\theta W_s + \\theta^2 s/2} IE \\{ e^{-\\theta W_t - \\theta^2 t/2} e^{iu(W_t - W_s + \\theta (t-s))} | \\mathcal{F}_s \\}\\]\n\n\\[= e^{(-\\theta^2/2 + iu\\theta)(t-s)} IE \\{ e^{i(u + i\\theta)(W_t - W_s)} | \\mathcal{F}_s \\}\\]\n\n\\[= e^{(-\\theta^2/2 + u\\theta)(t-s)} e^{-(u+i\\theta)^2 (t-s)/2}\\]\n\n\\[= e^{-u^2 (t-s)/2}.\\]\n\n### 1.4.2 Self-Financing Portfolios\n\nAs in Section 1.3.1, a portfolio comprises \\( a_t \\) units of stock and \\( b_t \\) in bonds; we denote by \\( V_t \\) its value at time \\( t \\):\n\n\\[V_t = a_t X_t + b_t e^{rt}.\\]\n\nThe self-financing property (1.28), namely \\( dV_t = a_t dX_t + rb_t e^{rt} dt \\), implies that the discounted value of the portfolio, \\( \\tilde{V}_t = e^{-rt} V_t \\), is a martingale under the risk-neutral probability \\( IP^\\star \\). This important property of self-financing portfolios is obtained as follows:\n\n\\[d\\tilde{V}_t = -re^{-rt} V_t dt + e^{-rt} dV_t\\]\n\n\\[= -re^{-rt} (a_t X_t + b_t e^{rt}) dt + e^{-rt} (a_t dX_t + rb_t e^{rt} dt)\\]\n\n\\[= -re^{-rt} a_t X_t dt + e^{-rt} a_t dX_t\\]\n\n\\[= a_t d(e^{-rt} X_t)\\]\n\n\\[= a_t d\\tilde{X}_t\\]\n\n\\[= \\sigma a_t \\tilde{X}_t dW_t^\\star \\quad (\\text{by (1.46)}),\\]\n\n(1.50)\n\nwhich shows that \\( (\\tilde{V}_t) \\) is a martingale under \\( IP^\\star \\) as a stochastic integral with respect to the Brownian motion \\( (W_t^\\star) \\). Indeed, the same computation shows that if a portfolio satisfies \\( d\\tilde{V}_t = a_t d\\tilde{X}_t \\) then it is self-financing.\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Risk-Neutral Pricing 21\n\nA simple calculation demonstrates the connection between martingales and no arbitrage. Suppose that \\( (a_t, b_t)_{0 \\leq t \\leq T} \\) is a self-financing arbitrage strategy; that is,\n\n\\[ V_T \\geq e^{rT} V_0 \\quad (IP \\text{-a.s.}), \\tag{1.51} \\]\n\nwith\n\n\\[ IP \\{ V_T > e^{rT} V_0 \\} > 0, \\tag{1.52} \\]\n\nso that the strategy never makes less than money in the bank and there is some chance of making more. But\n\n\\[ IE^\\star \\{ V_T \\} = e^{rT} V_0 \\]\n\nby the martingale property, so (1.51) and (1.52) cannot hold. This is because \\( IP \\) and \\( IP^\\star \\) are equivalent and so (1.51) and (1.52) also hold with \\( IP \\) replaced by \\( IP^\\star \\).\n\n1.4.3 Risk-Neutral Valuation\n\nAssume that \\( (a_t, b_t) \\) is a self-financing portfolio satisfying the same integrability conditions of Section 1.3.1 and replicating the European-style derivative with nonnegative payoff \\( H \\):\n\n\\[ a_T X_T + b_T e^{rT} = H, \\tag{1.53} \\]\n\nwhere we assume that \\( H \\) is a square integrable \\( \\mathcal{F}_T \\)-adapted random variable. This includes European calls and puts or more general standard European derivatives for which \\( H = h(X_T) \\), as well as other European-style exotic derivatives presented in Section 1.2.3.\n\nOn one hand, a no-arbitrage argument shows that the price at time \\( t \\) of this derivative should be the value \\( V_t \\) of this portfolio. On the other hand, as shown in Section 1.4.2, the discounted values \\( (\\tilde{V}_t) \\) of this portfolio form a martingale under the risk-neutral probability \\( IP^\\star \\) and consequently\n\n\\[ \\tilde{V}_t = IE^\\star \\{ \\tilde{V}_T \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t \\}, \\]\n\nwhich gives\n\n\\[ V_t = IE^\\star \\{ e^{-r(T-t)} H \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t \\} \\tag{1.54} \\]\n\nafter reintroducing the discounting factor and using the replicating property (1.53).\n\nAlternatively, given the risk-neutral valuation formula (1.54), we can find a self-financing replicating portfolio for the payoff \\( H \\). The existence of such a portfolio is guaranteed by an application of the martingale representation theorem: for \\( 0 \\leq t \\leq T \\),\n\n\\[ M_t = IE^\\star \\{ e^{-rT} H \\mid \\mathcal{F}_t \\} \\]"
