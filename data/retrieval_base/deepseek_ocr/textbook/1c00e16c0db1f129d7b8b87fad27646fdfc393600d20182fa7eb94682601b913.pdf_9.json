For example, 45% reported that their contributions would be reduced if their incomes dropped. However, 73% appeared to be optimistic about their job security in the coming year.\n\nFactors that could impinge on future giving include:\n• hearing that nonprofits have high overhead, salary, and administrative costs (65%)\n• too many requests for contributions (65%)\n• lack of sufficient information about how contributions will be spent (61%)\n• being financially unable to give (52%)\n• having other spending priorities (41%)\n• not being personally asked to give (34%)\n• losing a job (27%)\n\nEMPLOYER SUPPORT\nThe workplace plays an important role by encouraging giving and providing systems that simplify giving, such as payroll deduction. Many of those surveyed gave through programs offered by their employers, and were also able to increase the level of giving by using matching gift programs. Among the key findings about employer support in Kent County are:\n• Payroll deduction of contributions by employers was available for 49% of workers surveyed, and almost half of this group used the payroll deduction process. Both the existence and use of payroll deduction plans increases with income.\n\nPossible Reasons for Giving Less Next Year\n\nHearing that nonprofits have too much overhead\nBeing asked too often\nLack of info on how money is spent\nBeing financially unable to give\nHaving other spending priorities\nNot being asked to give\nLosing a job\n\npercent of population\n\n8"
