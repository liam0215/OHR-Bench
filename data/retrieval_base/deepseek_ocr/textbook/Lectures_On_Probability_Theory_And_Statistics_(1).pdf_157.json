As in the chordal case, we are in fact going to focus on the conformal geometry of the complement \\(H_t\\) of \\(K_t\\) in the unit disc \\(\\mathbb{U}\\). One first has to find a natural time-parametrization. It turns out to be convenient to define the conformal map \\(g_t\\) from \\(H_t\\) onto \\(\\mathbb{U}\\) that is normalised by\n\n\\[\ng_t(0) = 0 \\text{ and } g_t'(0) > 0.\n\\]\n\nNote that \\(g_t'(0) \\geq 1\\). This can be for instance derived using the fact that \\(\\log g_t'(0)\\) is the limit when \\(\\varepsilon \\to 0\\) of \\(\\log(1/\\varepsilon)\\) times the probability that a planar Brownian motion started from \\(\\varepsilon\\) hits the circle of radius \\(\\varepsilon^2\\) before exiting \\(H_t\\) (an analyst would find this justification very strange, for sure).\n\nThen (and this is simply because with obvious notation, \\((\\tilde{g}_s \\circ g_t)(0) = \\tilde{g}_s(0) \\circ g_t'(0)\\)), one measures the “size” \\(a(K_t)\\) of \\(K_t\\) via the derivative of \\(g_t\\) at the origin:\n\n\\[\ng_t'(0) = \\exp(a(t)).\n\\]\n\nHence, we will consider growing families of compact sets such that \\(a(K_t) = t\\).\n\nSuppose now that \\((\\zeta_t, t \\geq 0)\\) is a continuous function on the unit circle \\(\\partial \\mathbb{U}\\). Define for all \\(z \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{U}}\\), the solution \\(g_t(z)\\) to the ODE\n\n\\[\n\\partial_t g_t(z) = -g_t(z) \\frac{g_t(z) + \\zeta_t}{g_t(z) - \\zeta_t}\n\\]\n\nsuch that \\(g_0(z) = z\\). This solution is well-defined up to the (possibly infinite) time \\(T(z)\\) defined by\n\n\\[\nT(z) = \\sup\\{t > 0 : \\min_{s \\in [0,t)} |g_s(z) - \\zeta_s| > 0\\}.\n\\]\n\nWe then define\n\n\\[\nK_t := \\{z \\in \\overline{\\mathbb{U}} : T(z) \\leq t\\}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nU_t := \\mathbb{U} \\setminus K_t.\n\\]\n\nThe family \\((K_t, t \\geq 0)\\) is called the (radial) Loewner chain associated to the driving function \\(\\zeta\\).\n\nThe general statements that we described in the chordal case are also valid in this radial case. One can add one feature that has no analog in the chordal case: It is possible to estimate the Euclidean distance \\(d_t\\) from 0 to \\(K_t\\) in terms of \\(a(t) = t\\). Indeed, since \\(U_t\\) contains the disc \\(d_t \\times \\mathbb{U}\\), it is clear that \\(g_t'(0) \\leq 1/d_t\\). On the other hand, a classical result of the theory of"
