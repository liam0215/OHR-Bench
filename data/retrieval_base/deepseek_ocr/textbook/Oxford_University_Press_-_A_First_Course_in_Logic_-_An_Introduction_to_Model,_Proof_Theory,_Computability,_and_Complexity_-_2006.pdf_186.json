    "text": "(ii) Otherwise \\( \\varphi_{\\gamma} \\) has the form \\( \\exists x\\theta(x) \\). In this case let \\( T_{\\gamma+1} \\) be \\( T_{\\gamma} \\cup \\{\\varphi_{\\gamma}\\} \\cup \\{\\theta(c)\\} \\) where \\( c \\) is a constant in \\( C \\) that does not occur in \\( T_{\\gamma} \\cup \\{\\varphi_{\\gamma}\\} \\). Since \\( T_{\\gamma} \\) contains fewer than \\( \\kappa \\) constants of \\( C \\), such a \\( c \\) exists.\n\nSo if \\( \\beta = \\gamma + 1 \\), then \\( T_{\\beta} = T_{\\gamma+1} \\) is obtained by adding at most a sentence or two to \\( T_{\\gamma} \\). Since \\( T_{\\gamma} \\) contains at most \\( |\\gamma| + \\aleph_0 \\) of the constants in \\( C \\), so does \\( T_{\\beta} \\). Moreover, \\( T_{\\beta} \\) can be shown to be consistent in the same manner that \\( T_{m+1} \\) was shown to be consistent in the first claim in the proof of Theorem 4.2.\n\nNow suppose that \\( \\beta \\) is not a successor ordinal. Then it is a limit ordinal. In this case, define \\( T_{\\beta} \\) as the set of all \\( \\mathcal{V}^+ \\)-sentences that occur in \\( T_{\\gamma} \\) for some \\( \\gamma < \\beta \\). Again, we claim that \\( T_{\\beta} \\) is consistent and contains at most \\( |\\beta| + \\aleph_0 \\) of the constants in \\( C \\).\n\n**Claim 1** \\( T_{\\beta} \\) is consistent.\n\n**Proof** Suppose \\( T_{\\beta} \\) is not consistent. Then \\( T_{\\beta} \\vdash \\bot \\) for some contradiction \\( \\bot \\). Since formal proofs are finite, \\( \\Delta \\vdash \\bot \\) for some finite subset \\( \\Delta \\) of \\( T_{\\beta} \\). Since it is finite, \\( \\Delta \\subset T_{\\gamma} \\) for some \\( \\gamma < \\beta \\). But this contradicts our assumption that any such \\( T_{\\gamma} \\) is consistent. We conclude that \\( T_{\\beta} \\) must be consistent as was claimed.\n\n**Claim 2** \\( T_{\\beta} \\) contains at most \\( |\\beta| \\) of the constants in \\( C \\).\n\n**Proof** For each \\( \\gamma < \\beta \\), let \\( C_{\\gamma} \\) be the set of constants in \\( C \\) that occur in \\( T_{\\gamma} \\). Then the constants occurring in \\( T_{\\beta} \\) are \\( \\bigcup_{\\gamma < \\beta} C_{\\gamma} \\). By assumption, \\( |C_{\\gamma}| \\leq |\\gamma| + \\aleph_0 \\leq |\\beta| + \\aleph_0 \\). Since we are assuming that \\( \\beta \\) is a limit ordinal, \\( \\beta \\) is infinite. In particular, \\( |\\beta| + \\aleph_0 = |\\beta| \\). So each \\( |C_{\\gamma}| \\leq |\\beta| \\). It follows that the number of constants from \\( C \\) occurring in \\( T_{\\beta} \\) is\n\n\\[\n\\left| \\bigcup_{\\gamma < \\beta} C_{\\gamma} \\right| \\leq \\sum_{\\gamma < \\beta} |C_{\\gamma}| \\leq \\sum_{\\gamma < \\beta} |\\beta| = |\\beta| \\cdot |\\beta| = |\\beta|.\n\\]\n\nThis completes the proof of the claim.\n\nSo for each \\( \\beta < \\alpha \\) we have successfully defined a \\( \\mathcal{V}^+ \\)-theory \\( T_{\\beta} \\). These have been defined in such a way that \\( T_{\\beta_1} \\subset T_{\\beta_2} \\) for \\( \\beta_1 < \\beta_2 < \\alpha \\).\n\nWe now define \\( T_{\\alpha} \\) as the set of all \\( \\mathcal{V}^+ \\)-sentences that occur \\( T_{\\beta} \\) for some \\( \\beta < \\alpha \\). Like each \\( T_{\\beta} \\), \\( T_{\\alpha} \\) is a theory. This can be proved in the same manner as Claim 1 above. Unlike \\( T_{\\beta} \\) for \\( \\beta < \\alpha \\), \\( T_{\\alpha} \\) is a complete theory. This is because each \\( \\mathcal{V}^+ \\)-sentence is enumerated as \\( \\varphi_{\\alpha} \\) for some \\( \\alpha < \\alpha \\). Either \\( \\varphi_{\\alpha} \\) or \\( \\neg \\varphi_{\\alpha} \\) is in \\( T_{\\alpha+1} \\) and, hence, in \\( T_{\\alpha} \\) as well.\n\nSince \\( \\Gamma = T_0 \\subset T_{\\alpha} \\), \\( T_{\\alpha} \\) has Property 1. Moreover, part (b)ii of the definition of \\( T_{\\gamma+1} \\subset T_{\\alpha} \\) guarantees that \\( T_{\\alpha} \\) has Property 2. It was shown in the proof of Theorem 4.2 that any complete theory with Property 2 has a model. Therefore \\( T_{\\alpha} \\) has a model and \\( \\Gamma \\) is satisfiable. \\(\\square\\)"
