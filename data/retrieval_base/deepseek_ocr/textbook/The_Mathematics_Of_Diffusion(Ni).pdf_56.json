Heuristically, when \\( V \\equiv 1 \\), the first term in (3.34) and (3.35) is due to the volume energy which always has a tendency to “shrink” (in order to minimize), while the second term \\( \\pm \\beta e^{-2\\lambda(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} - \\rho)} \\) in (3.35) and (3.34), respectively, indicates that in the Dirichlet case the boundary “pushes” the mass of the solution away from the boundary (therefore only single-peak solutions are possible), but in the Neumann case the boundary “pulls” the mass of the solution and thereby reaches a balance at \\( \\varepsilon \\rho = r_{\\varepsilon} \\sim 1 - \\varepsilon |\\log \\varepsilon| \\) creating an extra solution.\n\nWe remark that the method described above also applies to the annulus case and yields the following interesting results for \\( V \\equiv 1 \\), which illustrate the opposite effects between Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions most vividly.\n\n**Theorem 3.11 (see [AMN3]).**\n\n(i) For every \\( p > 1 \\) and \\( \\varepsilon \\) small, the Neumann problem (3.1) with \\( \\Omega = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid 0 < a < |x| < b \\} \\) possesses a solution concentrating at \\( |x| = r_{\\varepsilon} \\), where \\( b - r_{\\varepsilon} \\sim \\varepsilon |\\log \\varepsilon| \\), near the outer boundary \\( |x| = b \\).\n\n(ii) For every \\( p > 1 \\) and \\( \\varepsilon \\) small, the Dirichlet problem (3.2) with \\( \\Omega = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid 0 \\leq a < |x| < b \\} \\) possesses a solution concentrating at \\( |x| \\sim r_{\\varepsilon} \\), where \\( r_{\\varepsilon} - a \\sim \\varepsilon |\\log \\varepsilon| \\), near the inner boundary \\( |x| = a \\).\n\nObserve that from the “moving plane” method [GNN1] it follows easily that the Dirichlet problem (3.2) does not have a solution concentrating on a sphere near the outer boundary \\( |x| = b \\).\n\nIn conclusion, we mention that the method of Theorem 3.10 can be extended to produce solutions with \\( k \\)-dimensional concentration sets, but again, some symmetry assumptions are needed. Other interesting progress in this direction includes a one-dimensional concentration set in the interior of a two-dimensional domain due to [WY]. The conjecture stated at the beginning of this section remains largely a major open problem.\n\n### 3.1.4 Remarks\n\nIn Section 3.1, we have considered the various concentration phenomena for essentially just one equation, namely,\n\n\\[\n\\varepsilon^2 \\Delta u - u + u^p = 0 \\tag{3.36}\n\\]\n\nin a bounded domain \\( \\Omega \\) under either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions in (3.2) or (3.1), respectively. However, since (3.36) is quite basic, similar phenomena could be"
