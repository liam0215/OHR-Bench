Assume further that the maps \\( \\alpha_p : G \\to M \\), \\( g \\mapsto pg \\) are injections for every \\( p \\in M \\). Show that the \\( G \\)-manifold has the structure of a differentiable \\( G \\)-principal bundle.\n\n4. Show that a bijective immersion of differentiable manifolds is a diffeomorphism. Hint: An immersion \\( f : M \\to N \\) is locally an embedding. If we had \\( \\dim N > \\dim M \\), then \\( f(M) \\) would have Lebesgue measure zero (locally) in \\( N \\) (see Bröcker and Jänich [1], §6).\n\n5. Show that any two fibers of the Hopf fibration (4.10) are linked in \\( S^3 \\); see Hopf [1].\n\n![Figure 12](image)\n\n6. Give a diffeomorphism \\( SO(3) \\cong \\mathbb{R}P^3 \\), and, if you know enough about fundamental groups, show that \\( \\pi_1(SO(n)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\) for \\( n > 2 \\) with a generator represented by the mapping \\( S^1 = SO(1) \\cong SO(n) \\).\n\n7. Show that \\( Sp(n) \\) is simply connected. Show that \\( SU(n) \\) is simply connected.\n\n8. Show that there is a \\( G \\)-equivariant diffeomorphism of homogeneous spaces \\( G/H \\cong G/K \\) if and only if \\( H \\) and \\( K \\) are conjugate in \\( G \\).\n\n9. Show that a homomorphism of tori \\( T^n \\to T^k \\) is induced by a linear map \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^k \\) whose associated matrix has integer coefficients.\n\n10. Show that the only noncompact topologically cyclic Lie group is \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\n11. Let \\( G \\) be a Lie group and let \\( X, Y \\in L(G) \\). Show that \\( [X, Y] = 0 \\) if and only if \\( \\exp(sX) \\cdot \\exp(tY) = \\exp(tY) \\cdot \\exp(sX) \\) for all \\( s, t \\in \\mathbb{R} \\). If \\( G \\) is connected, then the Lie algebra of the center of \\( G \\) is \\( \\{X \\in L(G) | [X, Y] = 0 \\text{ for all } Y \\in L(G) \\} \\).\n\n5. Invariant Integration\n\nLet \\( X \\) be a locally compact space and \\( C_c^\\infty(X) \\) be the vector space of continuous real-valued functions on \\( X \\) with compact support. An integral on \\( X \\) is a monotone linear map\n\n\\[\n\\int : C_c^\\infty(X) \\to \\mathbb{R}, \\quad f \\mapsto \\int f.\n\\]\n\n“Monotone” means that if \\( f(x) \\leq g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\in X \\), then \\( \\int f \\leq \\int g \\). The integral \\( \\int f \\) is often denoted \\( \\int_X f(x) \\, dx \\)."
