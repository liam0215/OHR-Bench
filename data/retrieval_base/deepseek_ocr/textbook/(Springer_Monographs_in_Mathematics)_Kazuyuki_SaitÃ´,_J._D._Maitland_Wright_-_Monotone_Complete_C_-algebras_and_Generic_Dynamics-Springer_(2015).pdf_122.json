    "text": "it follows that \\((d_n)\\) is a sequence in \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) which converges in the weak operator topology to \\(\\lim w_n - \\lim c_n\\). Since \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) is sequentially closed in the weak operator topology and \\(\\lim c_n\\) is in \\(W\\), it follows that \\(\\lim w_n\\) is in \\(W\\). So \\(W\\) is \\(\\sigma\\)-closed in \\(A''\\). Also, by Lemma 5.4.3,\n\n\\[\nk(\\lim w_n) = k(\\lim c_n) = c = \\bigvee_{n \\geq 1} c_n = \\bigvee_{n \\geq 1} k(w_n).\n\\]\n\nWe now come to the representation theorem for monotone \\(\\sigma\\)-complete \\(C^*\\)-algebras.\n\n**Theorem 5.4.5** Let \\(A\\) be monotone \\(\\sigma\\)-complete. There exists a \\(\\sigma\\)-homomorphism \\(q\\) from \\(A^\\infty\\) onto \\(A\\) such that \\(q(a) = a\\) for each \\(a \\in A\\). Then \\(A^\\infty \\cap \\mathcal{N}\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-ideal of \\(A^\\infty\\) and is the kernel of \\(q\\). So \\(A\\) is isomorphic to \\(A^\\infty / (A^\\infty \\cap \\mathcal{N})\\).\n\n**Proof** The smallest \\(\\sigma\\)-closed subspace of \\(A''_{sa}\\) which contains \\(A_{sa}\\) is \\(A^\\infty_{sa}\\). So \\(A^\\infty \\subset W\\). Let \\(q\\) be the restriction of \\(k\\) to \\(A^\\infty\\). The result follows from Corollary 5.4.4.\n\nWe recall that the algebra \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) is the complex linear span of \\(\\mathcal{M}^+\\). We shall see from the results of Sect. 5.6, that in Theorem 5.6.5, we may replace \\(A^\\infty \\cap \\mathcal{N}\\) by \\(A^\\infty \\cap \\mathcal{M}\\).\n\nWhen specialised to commutative algebras, Theorem 5.4.5 corresponds to the Loomis-Sikorski theorem for Boolean \\(\\sigma\\)-algebras [153].\n\nBy applying results of Birkhoff-Ulam for complete Boolean algebras, see Theorem 4.1.3, every commutative monotone complete \\(C^*\\)-algebra can be represented as follows. Let \\(S\\) be the spectrum of a commutative monotone complete \\(C^*\\)-algebra then \\(C(S)\\) is isomorphic to the quotient of the algebra of bounded Borel measurable functions on \\(S\\) modulo the ideal of meagre Borel functions. This may be thought of as a special case, for commutative algebras, of the following representation theorem. See Theorem 4.2.9.\n\n**Theorem 5.4.6** Let \\(A\\) be monotone complete. There exists a \\(\\sigma\\)-homomorphism \\(q\\) from \\(A^b\\) onto \\(A\\) such that \\(q(a) = a\\) for each \\(a \\notin A\\). Then \\(A^b \\cap \\mathcal{N}\\) is a \\(\\sigma\\)-ideal of \\(A^b\\) and is the kernel of \\(q\\). So \\(A\\) is isomorphic to \\(A^b / (A^b \\cap \\mathcal{N})\\). Let \\((c_\\lambda)\\) be a norm bounded increasing net in \\(A_{sa}\\) with least upper bound \\(c\\) in \\(A_{sa}\\). Let \\(\\lim c_\\lambda\\) be its strong (and so weak) operator limit in \\(A''\\) (and so is in \\(A^b\\)), then\n\n\\[\nq(\\lim c_\\lambda) = c.\n\\]\n\nFurthermore, given \\(f \\in A^b_{sa}\\), \\(q(f) \\leq 0\\) if and only if \\(f \\leq 0\\) a.e. So \\(q(f) = 0\\) if, and only if, \\(f = 0\\) a.e.\n\n**Proof** Let \\((c_\\lambda)\\) be a norm-bounded, upward directed net in \\(A_{sa}\\). Then \\(\\lim c_\\lambda\\) is in \\(A^b\\). By Lemma 5.4.3 \\(\\lim c_\\lambda\\) is also in \\(W\\). By definition, \\(A^b_{sa}\\) is the smallest \\(\\sigma\\)-closed subspace of \\(A''_{sa}\\) which contains all \\(x\\) that correspond to lower semicontinuous affine functions on \\(K\\). So \\(A^b \\subset W\\). Let \\(q\\) be the restriction of \\(k\\) to \\(A^b\\)."
