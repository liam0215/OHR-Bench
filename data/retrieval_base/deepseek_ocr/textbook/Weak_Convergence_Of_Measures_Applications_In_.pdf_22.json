    "text": "let \\( P \\) be a unit mass at \\( x \\) (that is, \\( P(A) \\) is 1 or 0 according as \\( x \\) lies in \\( A \\) or not) and let \\( P_n \\) be a unit mass at \\( x_n \\). Now if \\( 2/n \\) is less than the smallest nonzero \\( t_i \\), then \\( x \\) and \\( x_n \\) either both lie in \\( \\pi_{t_1^{-1} \\cdots t_k^{-1}} H \\) or else neither one does, so that \\( P \\pi_{t_1^{-1} \\cdots t_k^{-1}} (H) = P_n \\pi_{t_1^{-1} \\cdots t_k^{-1}} (H) \\). Therefore there is weak convergence \\( P_n \\pi_{t_1^{-1} \\cdots t_k^{-1}} \\Rightarrow P \\pi_{t_1^{-1} \\cdots t_k^{-1}} \\) in \\( R^k \\) for each \\( t_1, \\cdots, t_k \\). On the other hand, the set \\( \\{ y : y(t) \\leq 1/2, 0 \\leq t \\leq 1 \\} \\), the sphere of radius \\( 1/2 \\) about \\( x \\), is a \\( P \\)-continuity set and \\( P_n (A) = 1 \\) does not converge to \\( P(A) = 0 \\). Thus \\( P_n \\) does not converge weakly to \\( P \\).\n\nThis example shows that if there is convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions, that is, if\n\n\\[P_n \\pi_{t_1^{-1} \\cdots t_k^{-1}} \\Rightarrow \\pi_{t_1^{-1} \\cdots t_k^{-1}}\\]\n\nfor all \\( k \\) and \\( t_1, \\cdots, t_k \\), it does not follow that there is weak convergence of \\( P_n \\) to \\( P \\):\n\n\\[P_n \\Rightarrow P.\\]\n\n(The converse proposition of course does hold because of Corollary 2 to Theorem 3.3.) Thus weak convergence in \\( C \\) involves considerations going beyond finite-dimensional ones, which is why it is useful (see the introduction).\n\nOn the other hand, (5.1) does imply (5.2) in the presence of relative compactness.\n\n**Theorem 5.1.** If (5.1) holds for all \\( k \\) and \\( t_1, \\cdots, t_k \\), and if \\( \\{ P_n \\} \\) is relatively compact, then (5.2) holds.\n\n**Proof.** Since \\( \\{ P_n \\} \\) is relatively compact, each subsequence \\( \\{ P_{n_i} \\} \\) contains a further subsequence \\( \\{ P_{n_{i_m}} \\} \\) such that \\( P_{n_{i_m}} \\Rightarrow Q \\) as \\( m \\to \\infty \\) for some probability measure \\( Q \\) on \\( C \\). But then \\( P_{n_{i_m}} \\pi_{t_1^{-1} \\cdots t_k^{-1}} \\Rightarrow Q \\pi_{t_1^{-1} \\cdots t_k^{-1}} \\), so that, because of (5.1), \\( Q \\pi_{t_1^{-1} \\cdots t_k^{-1}} = P \\pi_{t_1^{-1} \\cdots t_k^{-1}} \\). Thus \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) have the same finite-dimensional distributions and, as observed above, this implies \\( P = Q \\). Thus each subsequence of \\( \\{ P_n \\} \\) contains a further subsequence converging weakly to \\( P \\), and (5.2) follows by Theorem 2.2.\n\n**Theorem 4.1** characterizes relative compactness by tightness. In order to apply Theorem 5.1 in concrete cases, we shall in turn characterize tightness by means of the Arzela–Ascoli theorem.\n\nFor \\( x \\in C \\) and \\( \\delta > 0 \\), the modulus of continuity is defined by\n\n\\[w_x (\\delta) = \\sup \\{ |x(s) - x(t)| : 0 \\leq s, t \\leq 1, |s - t| < \\delta \\}.\\]\n\nAccording to the Arzela–Ascoli theorem, a set \\( A \\) in \\( C \\) has compact closure if and only if\n\n\\[\\sup_{x \\in C} |x(0)| < \\infty\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\\lim_{\\delta \\to 0} \\sup_{x \\in C} w_x (\\delta) = 0.\\]\n\n**Theorem 5.2.** A family \\( \\Pi \\) of probability measures on \\( C \\) is tight (hence relatively compact) if and only if for each \\( \\eta \\) there exists an \\( a \\) such that\n\n\\[P \\{ x : |x(0)| > a \\} < \\eta, \\quad P \\in \\Pi,\\]\n\n(5.5)"
