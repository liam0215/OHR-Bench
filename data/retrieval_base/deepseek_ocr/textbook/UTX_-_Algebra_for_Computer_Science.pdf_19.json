With this notation, the previous theorem says that \\( a^{(p-1)/2} \\equiv (a|p)(p) \\) when \\( p \\) is a prime and \\( a \\) is prime to \\( p \\). The following important result will be proved in the third section of chapter 4.\n\n**The Quadratic Reciprocity Theorem.** Suppose that \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are odd primes. Then\n\\[(p|q)(q|p) = (-1)^{(p-1)(q-1)/4}.\\]\n\nNote. In other words, the product \\( (p|q)(q|p) \\) equals 1 unless both \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are \\( \\equiv 3 \\mod 4 \\), in which case it equals \\(-1\\).\n\nNote. This result, first proved by Gauss in 1801, is one of the most famous and beautiful results in number theory.\n\nR. Define \\( (a|p) \\) to be zero when \\( p \\) divides \\( a \\). It is obvious that \\( (a|p) = (b|p) \\) when \\( a \\equiv b \\ (p) \\). Prove that \\( (ab|p) = (a|p)(b|p) \\). (Hint: This amounts to the statement that the product of two squares mod \\( p \\) is a square mod \\( p \\) etc. At one point it is useful to know that there are as many squares as non-squares.)\n\nR. Verify that \\( (-1|p) = (-1)^{(p-1)/2} \\) and that \\( (a|2) = 1 \\) for all odd integers \\( a \\).\n\n**Examples**\n\nAny odd prime has the form \\( 6k + \\epsilon \\) where \\( \\epsilon = \\pm 1 \\). Hence \\( (p|3) = (6k + \\epsilon|3) = (\\epsilon|3) = \\epsilon \\), for 1 is a square mod 3 but not \\(-1\\). Similarly, \\( p \\equiv \\pm 1 \\) or \\(\\pm 2 \\mod 5 \\). In the first case, \\( (p|5) = 1 \\), in the second \\( (p|5) = -1 \\).\n\n**Exercise**\n\nDo the same computations with 7 taking the place of 5.\n\nThe quadratic reciprocity theorem has the following complement:\n\n**Theorem.** When \\( p > 2 \\) is a prime, \\( (2|p) = (-1)^c \\), where \\( c = (p^2 - 1)/8 \\).\n\nNote. The proof below is similar to one of Gauss's proofs of the quadratic reciprocity theorem.\n\nNote. Using this result and the quadratic reciprocity theorem, we can compute any \\( (n|p) \\) with \\( p \\) prime. In fact, reducing \\( n \\) modulo \\( p \\), we can assume that \\( 1 \\leq n < p \\) and then factor \\( n \\) into powers of primes. Since \\( (ab|p) = (a|p)(b|p) \\), this reduces the problem to the quadratic reciprocity theorem and the computation of \\( (2|p) \\).\n\n**Proof:** We are going to consider the numbers \\( C = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, (p-1)/2\\} \\), whose sum is \\( c = (p^2 - 1)/8 \\), and the set \\( 2C = \\{2, 4, \\ldots, p-1\\} \\).
