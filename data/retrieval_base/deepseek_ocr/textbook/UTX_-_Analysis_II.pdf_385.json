To see this without much calculating, first remark that\n\n\\[\nN_{p,q}(f) = N_0 (M^p D^q f) = \\|M^p D^q f\\|_\\mathbb{R}\n\\]\n\nand then \\( N_{p,q}(\\hat{f}) = N_0 (M^p D^q F f) = N_0 (M^p F M^q f) = N_0 (F D^p M^q f) \\) by the “commutation formulae” (31.2°) and (31.6). Now, in general,\n\n\\[\nN_0(Ff) = \\sup \\left| \\int f(x) \\overline{e(xy)} dx \\right| \\leq \\int |f(x)| dx = \\|f\\|_1;\n\\]\n\nsince the function \\( (x^2 + 1)f(x) \\) is bounded by \\( N_2(f) \\), by (3), one finds\n\n\\[\nN_0(Ff) \\leq N_2(f) \\int (x^2 + 1)^{-1} dx,\n\\]\n\nwith a convergent integral whose exact value, \\( c = \\pi \\), is not important. It follows that\n\n\\[\nN_{p,q}(\\hat{f}) = N_0 (F D^p M^q f) \\leq c N_2 (D^p M^q f);\n\\]\n\non applying (5) \\( p \\) times to the function \\( M^q f \\) one finds a result \\( \\leq N_{p+2} (M^q f) \\) up to a constant factor, and by applying (6) \\( q \\) times to \\( f \\) one obtains a relation of the form \\( N_{p,q}(\\hat{f}) \\leq N_{p+q+2}(f) \\) up to a constant factor. Remembering the definition (3) of \\( N_r \\), we finally have\n\n\\[\nN_r(\\hat{f}) \\leq c'_r N_{r+2}(f)\n\\]  \n(32.7)\n\nwhere \\( c'_r \\) is a new constant. This proves the continuity of the Fourier transform. Since it is bijective and quasi identical to its inverse map by virtue of the relation \\( \\hat{f}(x) = f(-x) \\), we conclude that the Fourier transform is a bijective and bicontinuous map of \\( \\mathcal{S} \\) onto \\( \\mathcal{S} \\), in other words what in topology one calls a homeomorphism (linear too) of \\( \\mathcal{S} \\) onto \\( \\mathcal{S} \\).\n\nWith their systematic recourse to the operators \\( D \\), \\( M \\) and \\( F \\), these calculations can appear a little abstract. But to write explicitly the integrals and derivatives which they mask would be even less enticing.\n\nWe can now return to distribution theory. Following Schwartz, we will call any continuous linear form \\( T : \\mathcal{S} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\) a tempered distribution on \\( \\mathbb{R} \\). The inequality \\( |T(f)| < \\varepsilon \\) has to hold for every \\( f \\in \\mathcal{S} \\) “close enough” to 0; this means that there exists an \\( r \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) and a \\( \\delta > 0 \\) such that"
