    "text": "• **Contraction** - real GDP begins to fall. If there is a contraction for more than two quarters, there is a **recession**. Real GDP falls and unemployment increases. Price levels slow and may fall down.\n• **Trough** - cycle’s minimum real GDP, end of contraction. Wide spread unemployment followed by expansion (recovery).\n• Sometimes called economic fluctuations because they are not predictable.\n\n#TRENDS\n• **Long-term growth trend** - the straight line that shows how output grows when the fluctuations are removed. The output is known as the **potential output**.\n• Unemployment falls when real GDP grows (expansion)\n  - firms hire more labor and increase quantity of output\n• Unemployment increases when real GDP falls (contraction)\n  - firms cut production and have to fire some workers\n• When an economy experiences **full employment**, there is still a **natural rate of unemployment**.\n  - If actual GDP > potential GDP, unemployment is lower than the natural rate.\n  - If potential GDP > actual GDP, unemployment is greater than the natural rate.\n• There is a **GDP (output) gap** if the actual GDP is above/below the potential GDP.\n\n#REASONS TO STUDY CYCLE\n• Real output growth mean that there’s a chance to have higher standards of living.\n• Large fluctuations not desirable, because with expansion, inflation could happen and with a contraction, unemployment increases.\n• Some key macroeconomic objectives: rapid economic growth, full employment, and price stability."
